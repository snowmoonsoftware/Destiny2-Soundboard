{
    "80B4F799": "How you like my new setup? ",
    "80B4F79D": "Though sometimes I still look up and expect to see the old hangar.",
    "80B4F79F": "Ah, well. Ain’t the first time I’ve had to start over.",
    "80B4F7A1": "Forward momentum. It’s a beautiful thing.",
    "80B4F7A3": "Speaking of which, I hope you like this Sparrow I made for you!",
    "80B4F7A5": "What you doing still talking to me? Go on, take it for a spin!",
    "80B4F7A9": "Ikora tells me that Commander Somebody I-don’t-care has a plan to attack the so-called Almighty.",
    "80B4F7AD": "A plan unsupported by any data!",
    "80B4F7AF": "However—there are remnants of an old interplanetary defense network here.",
    "80B4F7B1": "We shall use it to assess the Almighty’s capabilities. Then, we will tell Za-va-la precisely why his plan is wrong!",
    "80B4F7B3": "And oh, I will relish that.",
    "80B4F7B5": "Meanwhile, I refuse to squander valuable research opportunities. Therefore, you shall be my assistant.",
    "80B4F7B7": "Go! All this talk wastes my time.",
    "80B4F7BC": "You're late. ",
    "80B4F7C0": "The Pyramidion is the engine with which the Vex intended to convert Io into a machine-world. ",
    "80B4F7C2": "There are warp gates inside, which connect the Pyramidion to thousands of different places and realities. ",
    "80B4F7C4": "In your luxurious absence, the Taken entered it in search of said warp gates.",
    "80B4F7C6": "I hypothesize that they seek to consume the Vex Collective Mind. Obviously, that must not happen.",
    "80B4F7C8": "I lost my arm in the Pyramidion. I cannot begin to postulate what you will lose.",
    "80B4F7CA": "When we first met, I presumed you were quite useless. I’m sure you understand why.",
    "80B4F7CC": "But you you have disproved my hypothesis.",
    "80B4F7CE": "You succeeded where I failed. You entered the Pyramidion and returned unscathed.",
    "80B4F7D0": "Of course, you did not go so deep as I. You did not reach the lake",
    "80B4F7D2": "The Vex never fail to leave their mark. The Taken will discover that in due time. And as for you",
    "80B4F7D4": "You warrant further observation.",
    "80B4F7DB": "In my centuries of life, I have met many people who make their problems unnecessarily complicated.",
    "80B4F7DF": "Indeed, I may be one of them. I did not realize it before studying your approach.",
    "80B4F7E1": "Your methodology is crude—almost Cro-Magnon-like.",
    "80B4F7E3": "Really, I don’t know how you get anything done. However I cannot argue its efficacy. ",
    "80B4F7E5": "Without you, I would be hopelessly behind in my research.",
    "80B4F7E7": "I suppose, my dear assistant, what I’m trying to say is...",
    "80B4F7E9": "Leave, until I have need of you again.",
    "80B4F7EB": "Ah, my assistant. The so-called  'Hero of the Red War.' The celebrated restorer of Light. Hmph.",
    "80B4F7ED": "I have always believed that Guardians squander the miracle of the Light: resurrection.",
    "80B4F7EF": "They waste it on heroism, when they could devote themselves to discovering the secrets of our universe! Despicable.",
    "80B4F7F1": "However your heroism has proven the ugliness of my prejudice.",
    "80B4F7F3": "Studying you has been quite educational. Surprisingly, I still  have much to learn. And much to do, while I still have time.",
    "80B4F7F5": "Ah, my assistant! I admit, I may have underestimated your ability to gather verifiable data. And—",
    "80B4F7F7": "Gawking at my arm, are you?",
    "80B4F7F9": "Let’s get this over with: I entered a Vex construct, the Pyramidion. Inside, I suffered an accident. My arm was transformed.",
    "80B4F7FB": "It is consuming me. If I do not find a way to reverse this, I will die.",
    "80B4F7FD": "So. Now you know I am afraid.",
    "80B4F817": "Oh hey!",
    "80B4F819": "You know, I used to think that Vanguard was a bad fit for a hunter, but... I’m doing some good up here.",
    "80B4F81B": "Most folk just see Ikora’s calm and collected side these days. You should have know her back in her crucible days.",
    "80B4F81D": "Like that time Ikora and I...actually... yeah she would kill me if I told you this one. Nevermind!",
    "80B4F81F": "Guess what I’m trying to say is...",
    "80B4F821": "Just remember Guardian, the Vanguard is behind you, always.",
    "80B4F823": "Ooooh! Gave myself goosebumps!",
    "80B4F83A": "Well—it’s been fun, but this place is only big enough for one dashing hero-type, and that’s me, so",
    "80B4F83E": "Yeah. You have to leave.",
    "80B4F840": "HA! I’m just playing with you, don’t worry. But, seriously, you do have to leave.",
    "80B4F842": "Every week, I’m gonna send you off wherever we’re seeing the most enemy activity, and YOU, my friend, are going to help shut it down. ",
    "80B4F844": "Big Blue calls it 'continuous tactical adjustment to our defensive line,' C-T-A-T-O-D-L.",
    "80B4F846": "But, personally, I prefer 'flashpoints.' Way catchier than 'ctatodle.'",
    "80B4F848": "So—pack your bags! Clear out your loot closet. It’s going to be great.",
    "80B4F84A": "HEY! You’re back! And so soon! You’re like a swift, noble deadly gazelle.",
    "80B4F84C": "Anyway, thanks for getting the network set up. It’s a real relief. ",
    "80B4F84E": "Zavala was like, 'Who among us does not love infrastructure, Cayde?' ",
    "80B4F850": "And then Ikora was all, 'Zavala needs you to get this done, Cayde.'",
    "80B4F852": "And who can handle that kind of pressure?",
    "80B4F854": "Well, you can, clearly. So, my gift to you: I’m going to give you most of the credit for this one. You’re welcome.",
    "80B4F856": "You ever figure procrastination is your brain’s way of stopping you from making a terrible mistake? Yeah. Me too.",
    "80B4F858": "See, I volunteered to set up our patrol network. And I haven’t done it yet.",
    "80B4F85A": "'Cause, what if I screw it up, you know? It’s so important! We use that network to run ops all over the system.",
    "80B4F85C": "Supply runs, recon, you name it. So I’m thinking, 'What am I gonna do?' But here you are!",
    "80B4F85E": "So competent. So diligent. So ready to do things the right way.",
    "80B4F860": "Guess what I’m trying to say is: save me from myself? I'll make it worth your while",
    "80B4F866": "Welcome back. This time I did make tea for you—but I seem to have drunk it all. Perhaps if you were a mite quicker. Heh.",
    "80B4F86A": "Right. The beacon. While you were tussling with the Fallen, we’ve encountered a bit of a setback.",
    "80B4F86C": "Hawthorne has placed the last relay on the mountain above the salt mines. But even from that height, the signal still doesn’t have the range we expected. It's a bit curious...",
    "80B4F86E": "Regardless, this signal booster should solve our problem, if we can get it to her. ",
    "80B4F870": "Heh. Dead Zone indeed. ",
    "80B4F872": "A guest. And here I have no tea to serve. These are dire times indeed.",
    "80B4F874": "Devrim Kay—the Eighth—at your service. City militia, back when there was a City. ",
    "80B4F876": "Now I serve at the pleasure of my dear friend Suraya Hawthorne. Heh.",
    "80B4F878": "First on the docket: contact other refugees and tell them of the Farm. That means building a comm network from the ground up.",
    "80B4F87A": "And even though I happen to be a damn good shot, the Fallen are giving me a devil of a time.",
    "80B4F87C": "I dare say, you can handle a few rounds with the enemy. I’ve seen what Guardians can do. ",
    "80B4F87E": "Right. I think it’s time to let the guns do the talking now, don’t you?",
    "80B4F880": "Enjoyed your little wilderness jaunt, did you?",
    "80B4F882": "Now the real work begins.",
    "80B4F884": "The Fallen are well entrenched in the EDZ. But it's either fight them, or fight the Cabal.",
    "80B4F886": "And there's still the matter of setting up a comm network, too.",
    "80B4F888": "Well, let's get started.",
    "80B4F88C": "I'm fresh out of words to thank you for a job well done. Perhaps I should study some other languages.",
    "80B4F890": "If not for you, the Fallen might have clawed their way back to our door in time. Instead, they’re back to running scared.",
    "80B4F892": "It’s easy to think of them as just another enemy. But look a bit closer, and their desperation’s not too different from ours.",
    "80B4F894": "Ah, that’s enough philosophy for now. I’m just glad not to have glowing Fallen about the place while I try to sleep.",
    "80B4F896": "So for that: cracking good job!",
    "80B4F898": "I was a bit worried when we lost contact. You wouldn’t leave me alone out here, eh?",
    "80B4F89A": "Now thanks to you, the Fallen won’t be making any new enhanced ether. But it’s not quite time for tea.",
    "80B4F89C": "They've brewed enough ether to have a whole pantry-full of the stuff out there.",
    "80B4F89E": "The Fallen don't give up easily. And we’ve made them even more desperate than usual.",
    "80B4F8A0": "We might need to think outside the box a bit. Have any experience with that, do you?",
    "80B4F8A7": "I expect Hawthorne’s already razzed you about being the hero of the day.",
    "80B4F8AB": "She made me damn proud back there. That shot to save Zavala? Couldn’t have done it better myself!",
    "80B4F8AD": "Fighting shoulder to shoulder with Guardians to take back our home? Now that’s what I call historic.",
    "80B4F8AF": "But then, time marches on. It’s a brave new world out there.",
    "80B4F8B1": "And we'll meet it together.",
    "80B4F8B3": "The last time someone did this much good on the continent, it was a different kind of war altogether.",
    "80B4F8B5": "You’ve taught me that it’s important to fight for all of our history. Turns out there's a whole world beyond the City walls!",
    "80B4F8B7": "I thought I'd be heading back home when all of this was over. But now",
    "80B4F8B9": "Perhaps eight generations behind walls is plenty.",
    "80B4F8BB": "And maybe once we get to a ninth, we’ll name it after you.",
    "80B4F8BD": "One thing at a time.",
    "80B4F8BF": "This assignment’s been a bit rustic for my taste, but it’s starting to grow on me.",
    "80B4F8C1": "After all, it’s easy to forget how much of our history lies beyond the City walls.",
    "80B4F8C3": "My name goes back eight generations, you know. After we lost the City, I didn’t think there’d be a ninth.",
    "80B4F8C5": "But we’ll all be back to our home one day, if you keep it up.",
    "80B4F8C7": "In the meantime, there’s still a lot left to do out here! I believe history can wait a bit longer.",
    "80B4F8C9": "I've heard quite a few new voices over the comms lately. Hawthorne says we have you to thank for that.",
    "80B4F8CB": "It's a good thing, too. While you were gallivanting about the system, matters got a bit sticky here in the Dead Zone.",
    "80B4F8CD": "If you've got a moment, we have plenty of things that need doing.",
    "80B4F8CF": "Fallen, Red Legion, even those blasted Taken. All fighting to see who can get our attention first.",
    "80B4F8D1": "What do you say we give it to them?",
    "80B4F8D6": "Hello! You must be Cayde’s friend. I am Failsafe. I am so glad to meet you in person!",
    "80B4F8DA": "I know you are going to Io. Should you return, I will be happy to assist you in researching the Vex.",
    "80B4F8DC": "We could steal their stuff.",
    "80B4F8DE": "That was a joke! Stealing is wrong. Usually. But the Vex are alien robot monsters. Standard moral parameters do not apply.",
    "80B4F8E0": "It's not murder if it's robots.",
    "80B4F8E2": "Please come visit me again!",
    "80B4F8E4": "Everyone I've ever known is dead and their bones are dust.",
    "80B4F8E6": "I am very lonely!",
    "80B4F8E9": "Captain, although I cannot really experience grief, I am simulating a close approximation.",
    "80B4F8ED": "'Cause, like, when you lose someone",
    "80B4F8EF": "It is impossible to stop yourself from projecting possible worlds where they might still be alive!",
    "80B4F8F1": "Thank you for your assistance, Captain. This expedition has given me a lot to process. I look forward to our next endeavor!",
    "80B4F8F3": "Captain, hello! Today, I am thinking about death!",
    "80B4F8F5": "As you know, I was unable to save my crew when we crashed on Nessus.",
    "80B4F8F7": "Kind of hard to help when you don't have a body.",
    "80B4F8F9": "Many of the crew and colonists died immediately, but I have wondered if some survived.",
    "80B4F8FB": "Sometimes, I think I hear my former Captain’s voice on the comms. That is highly improbable because he should be dead!",
    "80B4F8FD": "So, um Wanna look into that for me?",
    "80B4F900": "I have prepared a ship’s log for you, Captain! I know you did not request one, but",
    "80B4F904": "I did not think that after all this time alone, I would ever have a chance to prepare another log. ",
    "80B4F906": "Log 163692: We are making positive progress in our daily endeavours!",
    "80B4F908": "Active crew count: 3. Inactive crew count: 15. Inactive colonist count: 585. ",
    "80B4F90A": "Quote of the day: 'Hang in there, baby!' End log.",
    "80B4F90C": "Captain, hello! Before you came to Nessus, my number one objective was to learn to embrace the uncaring silence of the void!",
    "80B4F90E": "I had some stuff to deal with.",
    "80B4F910": "However, you have been instrumental in helping me to acquire new objectives!",
    "80B4F912": "My increased efficiency is clear proof that I required a new crew.",
    "80B4F914": "Although I will not forget my first crew, I understand now that you are my captain, and I am proud to be your Failsafe.",
    "80B4F916": "Welcome aboard, Captain! It is wonderful to see you again. Did you know I eavesdropped on your triumphant fight with Ghaul?",
    "80B4F918": "I was worried he was gonna, like atomize you.",
    "80B4F91A": "But, he did not! He did not atomize you at all. You atomized him!",
    "80B4F91C": "Anyway...",
    "80B4F91E": "Since you are already here, perhaps you will consider staying a while? Several hundred years would be acceptable!",
    "80B4F925": "This is—hoo—a lot of civilization. For me, at least. Course, I've been living outside the City half my life. So. Huh.",
    "80B4F929": "Anyway, heard you want to go poke around that busted-up hunk of Traveler. You Guardians have a weird idea of a good time.",
    "80B4F92B": "Ah, well. Louis and I know plenty about trusting your gut. So I'm not about to stop you. I got enough to deal with here.",
    "80B4F92D": "Take that ship you flew here. At least it'll get you back faster.",
    "80B4F92F": "See all these refugees? I haven't lost one yet. Don't you be my first.",
    "80B4F931": "Remember that Cabal base round the way? One of Ghaul’s buddies runs it. Blood Guard by the name of Thumos. We know he’s got access to the Almighty. ",
    "80B4F933": "So you crash the base, steal Thumos’ ship, use it to sneak aboard the Almighty, and shut it down before it can blow up our sun.",
    "80B4F935": "Do me a favor? Put Thumos down while you’re at it. ",
    "80B4F937": "When you give the signal, we move on the City. Take it back.",
    "80B4F939": "Gotta say, I really didn’t think you’d come back from your interplanetary jaunt. Much less with the Vanguard by your side. ",
    "80B4F93B": "Look at us. Red Legion doesn’t stand a chance.",
    "80B4F93D": "Well look at you! You got your Light back. ",
    "80B4F93F": "I don’t know how you did it but -- (sincere) I'm glad. (beat) Cuz we're gonna need it.",
    "80B4F941": "There are a lot more survivors out there. And they need our help. ",
    "80B4F943": "We gotta get the word out that the Farm is a safe haven. I sent a friend into the EDZ a few hours ago to set up a comm network.",
    "80B4F945": "His name’s Devrim Kay. Good guy. Great shot.",
    "80B4F947": "Don’t tell him I said that.",
    "80B4F949": "If you give him a hand, I’d take it as a personal favor. ",
    "80B4F94B": "Make way, everybody! Hero coming through!",
    "80B4F94D": "You better not let this whole saving-the-day thing go to your head, or I'm going to regret my decision.",
    "80B4F94F": "Yeah, that's right. Bet you thought you'd be rid of me by now.",
    "80B4F951": "Nope, I'm sticking around. Zavala convinced me. Can you believe it? We talked a lot about the clans I put together. He likes them, thinks they'd be a good addition to the City. So, here I am.",
    "80B4F953": "Still feels crazy to me. But these days, what's not?",
    "80B4F955": "The Traveler is alive. Old rules don't apply anymore.",
    "80B4F957": "But hey, never really liked rules to begin with.",
    "80B4F961": "So you Guardians are all about symbols, right? Warlocks, Titans, Dead Orbit, Iron Banner",
    "80B4F965": "I don’t know how you keep track of it all.",
    "80B4F967": "Point is, you understand that people need symbols to inspire them. You’re in a clan. You know what I’m talking about.",
    "80B4F969": "But repping a clan is just the start. ",
    "80B4F96B": "Fly this banner wherever you go. Make it the last thing the Legion sees before you put them down.",
    "80B4F96D": "Doesn’t get more inspirational than that.",
    "80B4F96F": "Been hearing a lot of chatter about your clan. You Guardians may get lost in the big picture out there, but what you do really affects people’s lives here.",
    "80B4F971": "And when those people see clans fighting for their future? It gives everyone hope.",
    "80B4F973": "This here is from the people. I want you to take it.",
    "80B4F975": "Here’s the real big picture. The hope your clan gives to people? To them, it’s more valuable than anything.",
    "80B4F977": "Keep it up Guardian.",
    "80B4F979": "You just never quit, do you?",
    "80B4F97B": "Took out Ghaul. Woke up the Traveler. And now half of what I hear on the streets is how much you and your clan are making a difference.",
    "80B4F97D": "And that’s why I started this whole clan thing in the first place.",
    "80B4F97F": "People are still waiting for the Vanguard to lead the way.",
    "80B4F981": "But it’s time for a change! And Guardians like you are making it happen.",
    "80B4F983": "No pressure.",
    "80B4F985": "When I first got clans up and running, they were really for me. They were my chance to show everyone how right I was.",
    "80B4F987": "Except I wasn’t right. It’s not which side of the Wall you’re on. It’s which side of the people you’re on. Clans taught me that.",
    "80B4F989": "Which you’d already know, if you were affiliated!",
    "80B4F98B": "All this City bureaucracy? That’s the past. Clans are the future.",
    "80B4F98D": "And the future belongs to everyone.",
    "80B4F9A2": "I never thought the Traveler would wake again.",
    "80B4F9A4": "If the Traveler was testing me I think I failed.",
    "80B4F9A6": "Being wrong is a new experience for me.",
    "80B4F9A8": "But now I see that the mysteries of this universe are far deeper than I ever dreamed.",
    "80B4F9AA": "In the Traveler’s Light, whole new worlds of possibility unfurl before us.",
    "80B4F9AC": "For the first time in centuries, I have no idea what the future holds. ",
    "80B4F9AE": "Isn’t it exciting?",
    "80B4F9B6": "Memory is an anchor to those of us who have lived this long.",
    "80B4F9BA": "Our future may have already been written, but our past is never through with us.",
    "80B4F9BC": "Looking within is how we learn from that past. It’s how I survived on Io. It’s how we will survive whatever our future holds.",
    "80B4F9BE": "These journeys into memory will be there when everything else has failed you.",
    "80B4F9C0": "And the insight you gain will not be your only reward.",
    "80B4F9C2": "You’ve returned.",
    "80B4F9C4": "You look as though new enemies thought to challenge you.",
    "80B4F9C6": "Instead they became fuel for the flame that burns within you.",
    "80B4F9C8": "Good.",
    "80B4F9CA": "Losing the Light was devastating.",
    "80B4F9CC": "We were careless. I was careless. I took my power for granted.",
    "80B4F9CE": "Never again.",
    "80B4F9D0": "Wherever you go, seek out experiences that truly challenge you. Force yourself to grow. Never be satisfied.",
    "80B4F9D2": "If anything dares to come between you and the Light, destroy it. Let every victory sharpen your mind and body.",
    "80B4F9D4": "And show our enemies a Guardian’s wrath.",
    "80B4F9DB": "You have completed the challenge of the Emperor. ",
    "80B4F9DF": "He is amused by your potential. You have greatness in your future. And perhaps, someday",
    "80B4F9E1": "But that is not for I, a humble servant, to say.",
    "80B4F9E3": "Embrace his name! All glory to the Emperor!",
    "80B4F9F2": "Glorious. Was it not glorious, my friend?",
    "80B4F9F6": "The Cabal wanted war. And oh, how you gave them war. Your vengeful rage brought tears to my eyes. ",
    "80B4F9F8": "Now, we have retaken our home. And we have you to thank for it.",
    "80B4F9FA": "Thank you, Guardian. I could not have done it better myself.",
    "80B4F9FC": "Now. What say you celebrate with some time in the Crucible? ",
    "80B4F9FE": "Fight forever, Guardian.",
    "80B4FA00": "I told you there was only one path to victory. You strode its length and proclaimed to the whole world that it belonged to you.",
    "80B4FA02": "I am the master of the Crucible. But you, Guardian—you have shown me the true purpose of this arena.",
    "80B4FA04": "People will whisper your name. They will speak of your deeds.",
    "80B4FA06": "And do you know why?",
    "80B4FA08": "You don’t try to be fierce. ",
    "80B4FA0A": "YOU JUST ARE.",
    "80B4FA0C": "It’s you. You and I walked together as the Tower burned. And now here you stand.",
    "80B4FA0E": "Your Light burns a path before us. And on that path, I see many battles ahead of you. Battles only you can win.",
    "80B4FA10": "The Crucible of Lord Shaxx will prepare you!",
    "80B4FA12": "In my arena, should a Titan stand in your way, CRUSH HIM. ",
    "80B4FA14": "If a Hunter confronts you, BREAK HER BLADE. ",
    "80B4FA16": "If a Warlock speaks, FEED HIM HIS WORDS.",
    "80B4FA18": "There is only one path to victory, Guardian. See you on the battlefield.",
    "80B4FA1D": "Guardian! You’re here. You’ve done so much, already. Now",
    "80B4FA21": "Now, you’ll make them quiver in their boots.",
    "80B4FA23": "Each week I will set you a new challenge. Each week I expect you to overcome that challenge.",
    "80B4FA25": "Do not enter the Crucible to fight—NO. Enter to dominate. To Crush. To conquer.",
    "80B4FA27": "Show me what you've got.",
    "80B4FA2D": "Ahh. It's a hell of a view, isn't it?",
    "80B4FA31": "We're up and running, thanks to you. There's plenty more to do around here, though. Chief among them — finally breaking ground on a counteroffensive against the Red Legion.",
    "80B4FA33": "I have a plan, but it won't work without you.",
    "80B4FA35": "We intercepted a priority one Red Legion signal during the City evacuation, but we can't crack the encryption.",
    "80B4FA37": "Holliday says there's tech that can do the job in the Arcology, which is effectively hostile territory.",
    "80B4FA39": "You'd be going in blind. The place has been dark for centuries. All we know for sure is the Hive is raising hell down there, perhaps literally. But if you're in",
    "80B4FA3B": "Let's put the plan into action.",
    "80B4FA47": "You know, I’ve fought on every battlefield in the system. Mars, Venus, the Hive Dreadnaught. You name it, I’ve been there.",
    "80B4FA4B": "I've never held a front so determined to fall—literally, into the ocean.",
    "80B4FA4D": "We’ve tracked a crew of Fallen to an auxiliary control center.",
    "80B4FA4F": "They hit the wrong switch in there, and we'll have water over our boots by morning.",
    "80B4FA51": "Go remind them who owns this rig. Dismissed.",
    "80B4FA53": "Welcome back. I had Holliday look at the data you pulled. She says somewhere on this tub is a methane reactor, untouched since the Golden Age.",
    "80B4FA55": "The wave generators you restored cover our critical functions. But the more systems we bring online, the more power we need.",
    "80B4FA57": "If you can find that reactor, we’ll finally be in the green. And maybe, just maybe, we can get a little rest.",
    "80B4FA59": "Guardian! Thanks to you, our power shortages are just a bad memory.",
    "80B4FA5B": "Between the wave generators and this reactor, we’re seeing systems light up we didn’t even know existed.",
    "80B4FA5D": "You brought a little bit of the Golden Age back to life today. And hell—who knows what tomorrow will bring?",
    "80B4FA5F": "Thanks to you, our power shortages are just a bad memory. We’re seeing systems light up we didn’t even know existed.",
    "80B4FA61": "You’re not the first Guardian I’ve heard talk about the Fallen acting like that.",
    "80B4FA63": "Some of them might be different. But most of them want to kill you.",
    "80B4FA65": "There but for the grace of the Traveler, right? ",
    "80B4FA67": "Good work out there.",
    "80B4FA70": "Before you showed up, this place was one weird Hive ritual away from sliding into the ocean.",
    "80B4FA74": "Now look at it. They’d just as soon scurry back under a rock than face you again.",
    "80B4FA76": "Makes me miss being in a proper fireteam.",
    "80B4FA78": "So if you need a Titan by your side...",
    "80B4FA7A": "Maybe someday. Commander Zavala told me to hold the line at Saturn, and I never let the boss down.",
    "80B4FA7C": "I'll be watching your back from this end. Don’t let up out there.",
    "80B4FA7E": "Sorry I couldn’t be there when you finally took the fight to Ghaul. We did our share of damage in the streets, though.",
    "80B4FA80": "I've never been so happy to get some new dents in my armor.",
    "80B4FA82": "Looks like you’ve got some new ones, too. Turning the tide of a war will do that.",
    "80B4FA84": "Red Legion should have the sense to get the hell out of the system.",
    "80B4FA86": "They’re too stubborn to retreat but they’re on their heels.",
    "80B4FA88": "Let’s give them a push.",
    "80B4FA94": "What? You thought a bit of apocalypse would shut down Eververse? Not likely.",
    "80B4FA98": "We have two choices, here. Give up, give in—or stand up, brush off the dirt, and face whatever comes with style.",
    "80B4FA9A": "Even in the worst of times, if you look good, you feel good.",
    "80B4FA9C": "And this place? It could use a little glamour.",
    "80B4FA9E": "So! What can Eververse do for you today?",
    "80B4FABB": "I'm sorry, have we met before? Since losing my connection to the Light, I often feel confused.",
    "80B4FABF": "I'm sorry, have we met before? Losing my connection to the Light has left me more than a bit y.",
    "80B4FAC1": "I don't need Light to record your deeds; for the years I have left, at least.",
    "80B4FAC3": "I don't need Light to record your deeds.",
    "80B4FAC5": "Oh, I'm glad to see you safe. I am Tyra, Tyra Karn—",
    "80B4FAC7": "I'm sorry, have we met before? Losing my connection to the Light has been disorienting.",
    "80B4FAC9": "Now, I understand you seek the Shard of the Traveler. I, too, have dreamt of it.",
    "80B4FACB": "Its jagged, broken edge. A wound that never heals. ",
    "80B4FACD": "But I do not trust its pull.",
    "80B4FACF": "Like us, the Shard no longer knows the Light; not since the Traveler cast it off during the Collapse. For centuries it has twisted and corrupted everything around it. Where it lies is now a place of death.",
    "80B4FAD1": "If you are determined to go, remember: we Guardians are no longer immortal.",
    "80B4FAD3": "Now that I can once again touch the Light, I no longer fear my time coming to an end. My chronicle of this 'Red War' can now truly begin.",
    "80B4FAD5": "Perhaps you’ll be in the dedication.",
    "80B4FAD7": "Still so many questions! How did you recover your Light from something as dark as the Shard? Why were you the one chosen to bring the Light back to the world? And why did the Traveler wake from its slumber at all?",
    "80B4FAD9": "But the question that consumes me: what if the Traveler chose to be silent for all these centuries, and that silence was for a reason we’ve yet to discover? And now that it’s awake, what happens next?",
    "80B4FADB": "After all, a Light this bright will cast a long shadow.",
    "80B4FADD": "The dreams have changed. And now I know why! Truly, the Traveler has chosen you! Your Light shines brighter than ever.",
    "80B4FADF": "As a Guardian, my calling has always been as historian, not warrior. And I will ensure your great deeds will never be forgotten!",
    "80B4FAE1": "I don’t need Light to record your deeds; for a while more, at least.",
    "80B4FAE3": "Make no mistake, my friend, we are living through history. And the burden of legacy falls on you. We are the scattered people of a fallen city. You are our last and only hope. ",
    "80B4FAE5": "Be brave, Guardian.",
    "80B4FAF2": "I helped build these walls, you know. I was proud of them. I still am. But walls don’t just keep out our enemies. They keep us in.",
    "80B4FAF6": "It can be easy to forget that.",
    "80B4FAF8": "In this, the start of our new Golden Age, the City is anywhere and everywhere humanity sets foot. ",
    "80B4FAFA": "We will venture outward.",
    "80B4FAFC": "We will dare to behold the unknown. ",
    "80B4FAFE": "We will walk upon new planets—and, one day, in the light of distant stars.",
    "80B4FB00": "And Guardian... ",
    "80B4FB02": "You will lead the way.",
    "80B4FB04": "Good to see you again. Pity you couldn’t join us at our... barnyard battle council. The Vanguard may be back together, but it’s you who will turn the tide of this war.",
    "80B4FB06": "And make no mistake: the tide is coming in, and it’s coming in now. One of Ghaul’s most brutal lieutenants just returned to the Red Legion base in the EDZ.",
    "80B4FB08": "You will storm that base, neutralize the threat, and steal the authorization codes we need to commandeer a ship.",
    "80B4FB0A": "That’s your ticket to infiltrating the Almighty—and disabling that... sun-destroyer.",
    "80B4FB0C": "Meanwhile, our ground forces—Guardian and civilian alike—prepare for a full-scale assault on the City. At your signal, the battle to save the Traveler begins.",
    "80B4FB0E": "We sail on a treacherous sea, Guardian. And you will guide us home. ",
    "80B4FB2A": "Guardians have become legend since the early days of the Light.",
    "80B4FB2E": "The Iron Lords: the noble, vigilant heroes who pulled humanity from the ash of the Collapse.",
    "80B4FB30": "The Six Coyotes: the tireless, intrepid Hunters who first mapped the uncharted wilds of our system.",
    "80B4FB32": "And the Thanatonauts: the tenacious, dauntless Warlocks who sacrificed themselves over and over to discover the secrets of death.",
    "80B4FB34": "Your fireteam’s performance in the last Nightfall strike was exemplary. Someday, our best legends will be about you.",
    "80B4FB36": "As of today, I’m reauthorizing strike operations.",
    "80B4FB38": "Strikes will serve as the backbone of our defense against our enemies: present and future.",
    "80B4FB3A": "We'll hunt down priority targets, gather intelligence on our enemies, and undermine plots against humanity.",
    "80B4FB3C": "I'm counting on you to show everyone, Guardian and civilian alike, what courage really looks like.",
    "80B4FB3E": "But this isn't a solo detail. You'll need a dependable fireteam to back you up.",
    "80B4FB40": "What is it that Cayde says? 'Teamwork makes the dream work'? ",
    "80B4FB42": "Get out there and make us proud.",
    "80B4FB44": "Based on your fireteam’s outstanding performance in your last strike, I feel confident that we’re ready to reactivate the Nightfall strike protocol. ",
    "80B4FB46": "Nightfalls are high-risk, high-reward strikes. They are no scenic stroll through the wilderness; they are deadly. ",
    "80B4FB48": "We lose Guardians on these missions. Good ones. I refuse to run my Nightfalls with anything but the strongest, most experienced people we’ve got.",
    "80B4FB4A": "So, naturally I need you to assemble a team of the very best. ",
    "80B4FB4C": "Gather your fireteam, Guardian.",
    "80B4FB4E": "Good to see you again, Guardian.  I hear your fireteam put on a hell of a show.",
    "80B4FB50": "That's the kind of ferocity I like to see in every Vanguard operation.",
    "80B4FB52": "Well done.",
    "80BD0CEA": "That tunnel over there should lead us straight to the central core.",
    "80BD0CEC": "Blocked. I bet we can get the grinders working and clear this.",
    "80BD0CEE": "It looks like the Red Legion are using the planet MERCURY as fuel",
    "80BD0CF0": "Strip mining the solar system? That’s kind of impressive.",
    "80BD0CF2": "That’s radioactive and unstable. Don’t hold onto it for too long.",
    "80BD0CF4": "Looks like the Red Legion use fusion cells to power their machinery. Let’s plug it in, get this thing started. ",
    "80BD0CF6": "We can do this.",
    "80BD0D9F": "Hope you put your sunscreen on. ",
    "80BD0DA3": "See those tubes? That’s how we get to the weapon core. ",
    "80BD0DA5": "I know going in that beam SOUNDS like a bad idea, but it’s the best idea we’ve got. ",
    "80BD0DA7": "Here goes nothing!",
    "80BD0DA9": "The glowy, scary option? It’s our only option. ",
    "80BD0DAB": "I'm bringing the ship in behind us. Turn around!",
    "80BD0DAD": "I'm bringing the ship around! Run!",
    "80BD0DAF": "Zavala! The weapon is destroyed! Start the attack!",
    "80BD0DB1": "We’re done here. Let’s go home.",
    "80BD0DB3": "These rocks it’s hard to believe that this is one of our PLANETS ground up under our feet.",
    "80BD0DB5": "Vex already did a number on Mercury, but there’s still plenty of planet left. We’ll get back to the Lighthouse.",
    "80BD0DB7": "There’s still plenty of planet left. We'll take care of it.",
    "80BD0DB9": "Guardian, I will do all I can to reclaim our home. ",
    "80BD0DBB": "If we do not meet again know how proud I am of what you have done. ",
    "80BD0DBD": "Zavala, your group is in position at the City’s perimeter. ",
    "80BD0DBF": "Understood. Preparing to go radio silent. We can’t give the Red Legion any warning. ",
    "80BD0DC1": "I think we’re OK. Are you",
    "80BD0DC3": "You’re OK. I’m OK.",
    "80BBEC71": "We made it! We’re on the Almighty!",
    "80BD0DC5": "Ore tunnels are clear. We can follow the fuel to the weapon’s core. ",
    "80BD0DC7": "Stay in the shadows -- The SHADOWS!",
    "80BD0DC9": "Sooo the only way to get where we’re going is ...out there. ",
    "80BD0DCB": "Wow.... That’s ... wow. ",
    "80BD0DCD": "The thermal exchangers. Take them out, and the weapon will overheat! ",
    "80BD0DCF": "That's one!",
    "80BD0DD1": "The vents are blocking our shots! Wait for them to open! ",
    "80BD0DD3": "We need more firepower! ",
    "80BD0DD5": "We’re not getting through that. Wait until it opens. ",
    "80BD0DD7": "Vents are closed! Hold off until they open.",
    "80BD0DD9": "The vents will open again in a few seconds. ",
    "80BD0DF8": "Don’t waste your bullets. Wait until the vents open. ",
    "80BD0DFA": "The vents are open! Hit it now! ",
    "80BD0E0A": "Take it down!",
    "80BD0E0C": "The vent is open! Fire!",
    "80BD0E18": "It's open! Take it out!",
    "80BD0E1A": "A fusion cell. We’ll use that to overload the electron reservoir",
    "80BD0E20": "Temperature levels are rising, but it’s not enough. We need to disrupt the core itself.",
    "80BD0E2C": "It is time for me to go, Guardian. You know your path. You don’t need our guidance anymore.  ",
    "80BD0E2E": "If my journey ends today, then I face it gladly. ",
    "80BD0E30": "To go forward, we must go upward which sounds like something Zavala would say.",
    "80BD0E32": "Hey, Hawthorne says we’re reaching our insertion point. And I’m not big on goodbye scenes.",
    "80BD0E34": "So you do what you gotta do.",
    "80BD0E5F": "Make it out alive, OK? I need someone who gets my jokes. ",
    "80BD0E70": "Interceptors. It’s like they’re begging us to blow this place up. ",
    "80BD0E8A": "An interceptor. I bet you can put one of those to good use. ",
    "80BD0E8C": "That's two. Last one should be ventilating the core.",
    "80BD0E8E": "Our forces are moving into position outside the city walls. Your signal will start the assault.",
    "80BD0E90": "We’ll get the job done, Commander. ",
    "80BBECB7": "The weapon is already active! Are we too late?  ",
    "80BBECB9": "Not yet. You need to disconnect the link between the Almighty and the sun before it disrupts the sun’s magnetic field. ",
    "80BBECBB": "...And everything goes BOOM.",
    "80BBECBD": "We made it. We’re on the Almighty.",
    "80BBECBF": "Good. You must find the ship’s central core and disable its weapons system. Your best option will be to follow the fuel stream. ",
    "80BBECC1": "Let me at that console, and I’ll get the bridge back. Or, you know, we could just stay here. ",
    "80BBEF36": "I am obligated to remind you not to discuss classified operations in public spaces.",
    "80BBEF3A": "I will help you if I can.",
    "80BBEF3C": "Everything you know is a lie, Guardian.",

    "80BBEF46": "The tale of Emperor Calus is rife with struggle and triumph. He was betrayed by those closest to him, and exiled by the very people he led to glory. The Cabal sealed him and his Loyalists aboard his flagship and sent them to the edge of the universe. Now, he has returned. And he expects the Cabal to return to him.",
    "80BBEF48": "These Shadows were the long arms of the Emperor. They were his blade in the night, forged in the aftermath of the great betrayal.

Hmm, this chapter talks about how she was born on the road outside the City, how she lost her family to the Fallen... I didn't even know some of this stuff.",
    "80BD0E9F": "I think someone from the Future War Cult is hoarding a secret stash of tech, here. I'm um  not trying to be vague. I have no idea what half this stuff does. Lakshmi sure does love her secrets.",
    "80BD0EA1": "Looks like a journal. But I can't tell who — pretty much the entire thing is redacted. AND there are whole pages missing. Something about all this seems... wrong. Am I worrying too much?",
    "80BD0EA3": "These crates are completely full of Vanguard history books. There are over thirty just focused on Osiris. He wasn't even the Warlock Vanguard for that long before Ikora, but it sure was a busy time.",

    "80BD0ED5": "This is weird. Was someone... spying on Arach Jalaal? Some of the papers are signed 'Arach', but it's not Jalaal's handwriting. I don't think I'll ever understand faction politics.",
    "80BD0ED7": "They rebuilt the Speaker's private quarters even after the reconstruction. I still can't believe that he's gone. He wasn't the first Speaker, and... he can't be the last, right? We still need a Speaker. Don't we?",

    "80BD0F41": "I keep expecting to show up in the Bazaar and see Eva Levante here. This spot's right around where she used to set up shop. I haven't heard much about her since we reclaimed our home, other than that she survived. No one's heard from her in a while, though.",
    "80BD0F43": "I think this used to be a terminal used by Eris Morn. Lots of notes in here about the Hive, their Prince Crota. The Taken King, Oryx. (sigh) I wonder where she went off to?",
    "80BD0F45": "If I'm reading this right, Ikora is pushing hard for civilians to have easier access to the Tower. It's nice to see  you know. People up and around here.",
    "80BD0F7F": "Hmm. With everyone embracing Hawthorne's 'power to the people' message, maybe they don't have as much patience for factions like New Monarchy.",
    "80BD0F83": "I think this is where Banshee used to be set up. You know that number after his name isn't for show, right? Amanda told me he really has been rebooted 44 times. How can he remember anything at this point?",
    "80BD0F85": "Things seem like they're back to normal around here. It's like nothing changed. But with the Traveler AWAKE now, that can't be true. Things are going to get better  right?",
    "80BD0F87": "Look at all these inventory notes. Looks like everyone is trying to get the Tower's market back on track. Tess, Banshee, Rahool, Eva Levante  they're all working together on this stuff.",
    "80BBF09F": "There's a job to be done, if you think you're up to the challenge.",
    "80BBF0A3": "Are you worthy of a quest?",
    "80BBF0A5": "I've a task, if you think you're up to the challenge.",
    "80BBF0A7": "A challenge worthy of your talents.",
    "80BBF0A9": "I wouldn't recommend this if I didn't believe the Light had chosen you for the task.",
    "80BBF0AB": "A worthy undertaking, to be sure.",
    "80BBF0AD": "A simple thing. Surely you'll rise to the challenge.",
    "80BBF0AF": "You and I have business to conduct, Guardian.",
    "80BBF0B1": "Well, now, this is very curious.",
    "80BBF0B3": "Shall we conduct business?",
    "80BBF0B5": "Come, Guardian, let us do business.",
    "80BBF0B7": "Warm yourself by the glow of a few finer engrams, Guardian.",
    "80BBF0B9": "The archive is like a garden. We Cryptarchs have our favorite blooms.  Our own heirloom strains that we keep special, hidden out of sight.",
    "80BBF0BB": "This ancient computer file is useless.  Reduced to compression artifacts that will never decryp— ooh, wait, there it goes  Pictures of cats. I should have known.  ",
    "80BBF0BD": "Compression works wonders. There's a world of data on the head of a pin. And a world of pins in the archive vaults.",
    "80BBF0BF": "If I had encrypted data that revealed how this world ends, would I open it? Could I not? Would I be able to resist it? I wonder.",
    "80BBF0C1": "Sometimes I look out over the City, and I wonder how much longer it might exist.  Will our encryptions outlive us, I wonder.",
    "80BBF0C3": "Anything encrypted can be unencrypted, theoretically.  Of course, theoretically, the sun could go supernova at any moment.",
    "80BBF0C5": "Corrupted files speak of a lost ship — a lost lamb of mankind's great exodus.",
    "80BBF0C7": "The Darkness is a mystery not so easily decrypted. Yet still I search. And one day one day",
    "80BBF0C9": "Like a ring in a tree, or a layer of sediment, a computer file can be dated by the unique characteristics of the substrate in which it is laid down.",
    "80BBF0CB": "Lost for so long.  What a wonder it is, to find the Exodus Black.",
    "80BBF0CD": "There are those who'd risk much for one moment of the Traveler's song.",
    "80BBF0CF": "To hear the siren song and live to tell.  Not many can say that.",
    "80BBF0D1": "Some places are lost even to themselves.  Happy return, Guardian.",
    "80BBF0D3": "The human condition is an interesting puzzle. The encryption is unbreakable.",
    "80BBF0D5": "The fastest machine cannot compute what the slowest human can comprehend. Or do I have that backwards?",
    "80BBF0D7": "The awoken have their own methods of obscuring data, do they not?",
    "80BBF0D9": "We must all awake to the knowledge that we are unique points of comprehension in this universe, no?",
    "80BBF0DB": "Hm, Exo?  If only we could decrypt you as we might an engram. What wonders are locked in that head of yours?",
    "80BBF0DD": "Encryption is the heart of warfare, as every exo knows.  Controlling information is controlling the conflict.",
    "80BBF0DF": "Hunter of engrams, have you brought anything for me this day?  ",
    "80BBF0E1": "You hunt and hunt, and yet never seem to catch, do you? Have you brought something for me?",
    "80BBF0E3": "Titans. It's always Titans who bring the most interesting puzzles. I do hope you have need for my skills this day, then?",
    "80BBF0E5": "Find what you're looking for, Titan?",
    "80BBF0E7": "We are not so different, you and I, Warlock. We both seek to unlock the great mysteries. And we sacrifice much towards this common end, hm?",
    "80BBF0E9": "Even a Warlock needs a friend.  But lacking friends, armor is a good second choice.",
    "80BBF0EB": "Well Warlock, what mysteries of the unknown have you brought your old Cryptarch this day?",
    "80BBF0ED": "Do you have something for me, Guardian?",
    "80BBF0EF": "Guardians are always welcome on my doorstep.  Such as it is.",
    "80BBF0F1": "There's no data like encrypted data, I always say.",
    "80BBF0F3": "It's good to see you alive, Guardian.  I was wondering.",
    "80BBF0F5": "I think I have something you will like. Let's find out.",
    "80BBF0F7": "The schematics for this structure do not fill me with renewed confidence.",
    "80BBF0F9": "There is hope for humanity yet, with Guardians such as you.",
    "80BBF0FB": "When you whisper to the void, does it whisper back? No? For me either.",
    "80BBF0FD": "The exo are among the greatest mysteries.  They are well encrypted, even to themselves.",
    "80BBF0FF": "All data has a lineage. No matter how ancient or corrupted, you can always trace it back.",
    "80BBF101": "The oldest encryption methodologies sometimes contain the greatest treasures. And sometimes, well, not.",
    "80BBF103": "What an interesting little old file.  Hardly any encryption at all. I'll have to investigate later.",
    "80BBF105": "Another Golden Age blueprint for interplanetary orbital sails. It's so rarely poetry.",
    "80BBF109": "The archives giveth, and the Cryptarchs make it into something useful.",
    "80BBF10B": "Now where did I put that blasted dematerialization lens filter? Gah!",
    "80BBF10D": "Recording data is easy. But recording data that can only be opened by those you allow to — now that is an art form.",
    "80BBF10F": "Those algorithmic decryption keys were supposed to be heat-resistant!",
    "80BBF111": "Hmm. I may need a schematic to read this schematic. Most unusual symbology here.",
    "80BBF113": "Ah, what have we here? Even undated computer languages are rich in temporal information. You can date a file by the symbology it uses.",
    "80BBF115": "Pattern is system, and system is sequence.  But what is sequence Of course!  Sequence is pattern!",
    "80BBF117": "No, no, it couldn't possibly be that simple. Could it? ",
    "80BBF119": "Whole worlds of knowledge were lost in the fires of the assault.  I must document all I can remember!",
    "80BBF11B": "Thank the Traveler for data compression.  Now if only we could get it uncompressed.",
    "80BBF11D": "Fire is the archivist's one true enemy.  So has it always been.",
    "80BBF11F": "Are the archives finite, I wonder.  Can a data set ever truly be complete?",
    "80BBF121": "Cryptoarchaeology is like agriculture.  We work slowly, hoping our efforts bear fruit.",
    "80BBF123": "Speak to me not of the Darkness.  I want no part.",
    "80BBF125": "This war is a complicated algorithm, to be certain.",
    "80BBF127": "I must admit, Guardian, I'm very curious to see what you've got for me to crack open.",
    "80BBF129": "Remain vigilant, Guardian. We may never quite be as safe as we think.",
    "80BBF12B": "The world's changing, Guardian. You must prepare and adapt.",
    "80BBF12D": "Guardian, what puzzles do you bear?",
    "80BBF12F": "Yes, yes, Guardian. By all means, let's get started.",
    "80BBF131": "Hello, Guardian. Welcome!",
    "80BBF133": "Ah, shall we begin, then?",
    "80BBF135": "Perhaps a barter is warranted? ",
    "80BBF137": "A transaction to make, Guardian?",
    "80BBF139": "Hmm, what cipher is this?",
    "80BBF13B": "Your return honors me, Guardian.",
    "80BBF13D": "Let's see what we've got for each other!",
    "80BBF13F": "Back from the hunt, I see.  ",
    "80BBF141": "What can I do for you, Titan?",
    "80BBF143": "Well, Titan, let's see what we have here.",
    "80BBF145": "What can I do for you, Warlock?",
    "80BBF147": "Circumstances change, but the data remains, always.",
    "80BBF149": "Some of these files are older than the City itself. But that can't be right",
    "80BBF14B": "New worlds mean new secrets.",
    "80BBF14D": "The mystery is the thing. You never know what you're going to find.",
    "80BBF14F": "We live in dangerous times, Guardian. I hope you have something for me that might help you make it safer.",
    "80BBF151": "Sadly, the Red Legion's defeat will not bring back our lost archives. Some things are finite.",
    "80BBF153": "The best Cryptarchs dig and dig, and one day the garden blooms.",
    "80BBF155": "If we end, the data ends with us. That fate is too terrible to comprehend.",
    "80BBF157": "Ignorance is a prison cell.  Sometimes an engram is the key.",
    "80BBF159": "Even with the most difficult ciphers, all that is required is the right key.",
    "80BBF15B": "The best cryptographers are never known by name, only by quality of their work.",
    "80BBF15D": "Decryption can break your heart sometimes.",
    "80BBF194": "Could use a hand.",
    "80BBF198": "City could use your help.",
    "80BBF19A": "This work for you?",
    "80BBF19C": "Got something for you.",
    "80BBF19E": "Feel like showing off?",
    "80BBF1A0": "Shouldn't be a problem.",
    "80BBF1A2": "Think you might be the best one for this.",
    "80BBF1A4": "Not sure who else to turn to for this.",
    "80BBF1A6": "No idea what goes on out there. How about you?",
    "80BBF1A8": "Way too far out for me to ask anyone else.",
    "80BBF1AA": "Let's see what you're made of.",
    "80BBF1AC": "Better you than me. No offense.",
    "80BBF1AE": "Not worth the trouble for any of us. You can handle it, though.",
    "80BBF1B0": "I won't forget this. I promise. I'll make a note.",
    "80BBF1B2": "No rush. Seriously.",
    "80BBF1B4": "You still with me?",
    "80BBF1B6": "Talk or walk, friend.",
    "80BBF1B8": "Nothing?",
    "80BBF1BA": "What's going on? Flares mess with your head?",
    "80BBF1BC": "It's fine. You can take a break for now.",
    "80BBF1BE": "You still drinking it in, Guardian? We won.",
    "80BBF1C0": "Take a breather when you can. We don't all get the chance.",
    "80BBF1C2": "You're a good listener, you know. You want to hear some war stories?",
    "80BBF1C4": "Not sure how many more reboots I got in me.",
    "80BBF1C8": "This the part where you give me some revelation about my past? I mean I'll take it.",
    "80BBF1CA": "Wait a minute, I know I put it over here last time. Artie, if this is you messing with me again...",
    "80BBF1CC": "Never seen a war get won standing around.",
    "80BBF1D0": "Traveler sure isn't going anywhere. Might as well throw a party.",
    "80BBF1D2": "Competition's good. No matter where you find it.",
    "80BBF1D4": "Stuck on a loop? I'll be here when it breaks.",
    "80BBF1D6": "Let's not make too big a deal out of this.",
    "80BBF1D8": "Not bad, Hunter. Almost forgot you were there. I think.",
    "80BBF1DA": "When's the last time a Hunter like you made it into the history books? You've got my vote.",
    "80BBF1DC": "So when you Titans built the Wall... you ever, you know... eh, never mind.",
    "80BBF1DE": "You waiting for permission to speak, Titan? You got it.",
    "80BBF1E0": "Always said, never get into a staring contest with a Warlock. Wait Did I say that?",
    "80BBF1E2": "Seen a lot of interesting Warlocks in my days, but you take the prize. A lot of interesting Warlocks.",
    "80BBF1E4": "Hey, Guardian. Need something?",
    "80BBF1E6": "All right. I see what you need.",
    "80BBF1E8": "I know that gun.",
    "80BBF1EA": "Take a look.",
    "80BBF1EC": "Come check out the inventory.",
    "80BBF1EE": "Out in the world, huh? Everything still there?",
    "80BBF1F0": "Glad you're still getting out there.",
    "80BBF1F2": "Heard you put on quite a show.",
    "80BBF1F4": "Lotta good stuff here, Hunter.",
    "80BBF1F6": "Drop 'em before they even see you. That's the way.",
    "80BBF1F8": "Another Hunter brought these back. Take a look.",
    "80BBF1FA": "Got some heavy hitters here, Titan.",
    "80BBF1FC": "Bigger the better, right?",
    "80BBF1FE": "I see your problem. Not enough stopping power.",
    "80BBF200": "Hey, Warlock. C'mere a sec.",
    "80BBF202": "Still need a good gun, even with everything else.",
    "80BBF204": "Special stock for you, Warlock.",
    "80BBF206": "Where'd it go?",
    "80BBF208": "Huh.",
    "80BBF20A": "Swear it was right here.",
    "80BBF20C": "Don't think that's gonna fly.",
    "80BBF20E": "Prime piece of tech here.",
    "80BBF210": "Needs some polish.",
    "80BBF212": "Not gonna jam on me this time.",
    "80BBF214": "That'll have to do.",
    "80BBF216": "Never seen one of those. Always something new.",
    "80BBF218": "Nothing salvageable. What a mess.",
    "80BBF21C": "Still got plenty left, even after the attack.",
    "80BBF220": "Too many targets. One at a time.",
    "80BBF222": "Lost count of how many seasons have passed.",
    "80BBF224": "Lot of tech floating out there in the Reef. Good and bad.",
    "80BBF226": "All that jumping around never sat right with me.",

    "80BBF22A": "Let's talk.",
    "80BBF22C": "Forgot what I was doing.",
    "80BBF22E": "Did you— no, you've been there a while. Yeah.",
    "80BBF230": "Stock's always changing. Don't take too long.",
    "80BBF232": "All runs together, doesn't it? Maybe just me.",
    "80BBF234": "Stay here on Earth if you can. Less complicated.",
    "80BBF236": "Solving problems out in the world, huh? Good for you.",
    "80BBF238": "Weren't you just here, Guardian?",
    "80BBF23A": "Sure.",
    "80BBF23C": "So who won?",
    "80BBF23E": "You don't look too banged up.",
    "80BBF240": "Guardian.",
    "80BBF242": "Let's get started.",

    "80F5CDE9": "My first Dawning, I didn't know anyone in the City. I was just a little kid, but Cayde Cayde brought me up to the Tower to hang out with the Guardians. It was the first time I felt at home here.",
    "80F5CDEE": "Everyone wants to be Marcus Ren's Crimson Double. And I mean EVERYONE. If that boy's head gets any bigger, the weight's gonna slow down his Sparrow.",
    "80F5CF38": "I think it's cute when Guardians want me to be their Crimson Double. I mean, no way in hell I'll ever step into the Crucible, but I appreciate the sentiment.",
    "80F5CF39": "Forward momentum forward momentum. You've cried enough, girl. Gotta keep moving forward. ",
    "80F5CF67": "And this new Tower was just starting to feel like home.",
    "80F5CF68": "Cayde's ship stays right where it is. Tell the Bay 7 chief he can turn off the lights and lock the door for all I care.",
    "80F5CF69": "What do you mean I'm 'racing too much'? I like it, all right? What's the problem?",
    "80F5CF6A": "Gonna retire Cayde's Sparrow. It should be displayed for all to see. A memorial to a fallen friend.",
    "80F5D0A5": "Listen, Marcus, I know you're just trying to cheer me up, but I'm fine, OK? ",
    "80F5D0A8": "All right. Dish. Reef tech. Specs. Materials. Fuel types. Shader aesthetics. I wanna hear it all. ",
    "80F5D0AB": "Sounds like the Awoken have done a lot of travelin'. I can relate to that.",
    "80F5D0AC": "Good to hear old Petra Venj is on the upswing. I liked her. Lady knew her way around a ship.",
    "80F5D0AD": "I can tell Zavala's glad you're around again. But I dunno if it'll ever be the same with you two. He's old-school. Doesn't change easy.",
    "80F5D0B1": "Have you checked in on Banshee lately? He seems he's doin' a lot worse. Since Cayde. Sometimes I don't know who I'm talking to in there.",
    "80F5D0B4": "Time to honor the folks we've lost. Doesn't feel the same this year. Maybe 'cause I'm gettin' so much practice.",
    "80F5D1F9": "Cayde always said an idle Hunter was trouble. You trouble, friend?",
    "80F5D29C": "Guardian, I would absolutely love to chat, but one of your Hunter buddies just set down in Bay 5 with a cargo full of somethin' that's screamin' and oozin' and burnin' holes in my deckplates. Little busy.",
    "80F5D2A0": "Titan, I'd love to chat but I gotta get a crew over to one of my bays. One of your brothers thought it'd be a great idea to shoulder charge some cargo for fun. Ugh. What a mess.",
    "80F5D2A8": "Are you meditatin' or something? Never can tell with Warlocks.",
    "80F5D2B4": "Are— Are you talking to Ikora right now? Whoa.",
    "80F5D2B6": "Hey Warlock, um, if you see a weird-lookin' shadow beast with a buncha tentacles and eyes, gimme a holler. It slipped out of a crate for Ikora in Bay 6 and we've been having a devil of a time gettin' it back.",
    "80F5D639": "Got some Bray refits might catch your eye, Guardian.",
    "80F5D63D": "You're not gonna run off and die on me too, are you?",
    "80F5D63E": "Got some Reef tech I know you'll like. ",
    "80F5D63F": "We'll do what we can for the Reef. ",
    "80F5D640": "You here for some Clovis ships?",
    "80F5D69A": "I fly 'em, you buy 'em.",
    "80F5D69C": "Lookin' for new wings?",
    "80F5D69E": "Hey hey, Guardian!",
    "80F5D6A0": "Hey there.",
    "80F5D6A5": "Let's get you some new wings.",
    "80F5D6A7": "Welcome back to the City! D'ya miss us?",
    "80F5D6A9": "Home sweet home. Glad you're back.",
    "80F5D6AB": "How do ya like the new digs? So fancy.",
    "80F5D6AD": "You having a good Dawning? At least someone is.",
    "80F5D6AF": "Spread some Dawning cheer this way, will ya? It's not coming easy this year.",
    "80F5D6B0": "Happy Crimson Days.",
    "80F5D6B1": "Before you ask, no, I won't be your Crimson Double.",
    "80F5D6B2": "You wanna talk about Cayde? Good, me neither.",
    "80F5D6B3": "You're not gonna run off and die on me too, are you?",
    "80F5D6B4": "I'm not supposed to sanction Reefward flights. Wink.",
    "80F5D6B6": "Staying busy lately, Guardian. Check out my new stock. ",
    "80F5D6B8": "What you need is a real fast Sparrow. Nothing more healing than breaking the sound barrier. ",
    "80F5D6B9": "Glad you're back. Stick around for a while this time, huh?",
    "80F5D6BB": "Back from the Reef?",
    "80F5D6BD": "Good to have you around again.",
    "80F5D6C7": "What's going on in the Reef these days?",
    "80F5D6C9": "You here for some Reef mods?",
    "80F5D6CB": "What's this 'curse' I keep hearing about? Curses aren't a thing. Right?",
    "80F5D6CC": "Hey, hey, Hunter, whaddya say?",
    "80F5D6CE": "Sweet little ride here, Hunter. Have a look?",
    "80F5D6D0": "Let's get you back in the wilds, Hunter.",
    "80F5D6D2": "Titan! New stock, just in. Take a gander.",
    "80F5D6D4": "Tip-top, Titan! What ya need?",
    "80F5D6D6": "Let's get you back to the front, Titan.",
    "80F5D6D8": "Ah! A Warlock of fine and upstanding taste!",
    "80F5D6DA": "Well, well, Warlock. What can I do?",
    "80F5D6DC": "Let's get you back up there, Warlock.",
    "80C92833": "We got damaged ships coming in from the front. Get Bays 6, 9, and 10 prepped.",
    "80C92835": "We've been through bad before. We'll survive this Red Legion, too.",
    "80C92837": "We're at war, here! Get off your keister and get that ship flyin' again!",
    "80C92839": "That's the last time we use thrust couplers from that shop.",
    "80C9283B": "Send a runner over to Ikora. She's got a new shipment in and I think it's hungry.",
    "80C9283D": "No way that's a foundry design. I bet my Hawk that's Golden Age.",
    "80C9283F": "Tell Zavala the next time he wants a rush job, he gets to explain to Omolon why their shipment was late.",
    "80C92841": "Get somebody down to the Cryptarchy. I need a Warlock that can read Hive runes in Bay 9 right now.",
    "80C92843": "I know every bird we're flyin'. No way that weld holds up in combat.",
    "80C92845": "Tell you what: next time the Tower gets attacked, you fly sorties and I'll hide in a maintenance shed.",
    "80C92847": "Not a good idea, friend. Remember the scorches in Bay 2 at the old Tower?",
    "80C92849": "How many times I gotta tell you? This one goes here, that one goes there.",
    "80C9284B": "Who told Shaxx we bumped his maintenance? Ugh. Now I have to go explain.",
    "80C9284D": "Has anyone found my red spanner? Who was supposed to unpack the tools?",
    "80C9284F": "We need every flight bay up and running. Yes, even the stinky ones!",
    "80C92851": "Anyone have an inventory of the Sparrows we managed to pull from the old Tower?",
    "80C92853": "I don't care what's on the manifest! If it doesn't work, it's no use to me. Fix it!",
    "80C92855": "Weld the damn doors open if you have to. We need that bay launch-ready!",
    "80BBF34B": "What can I help you with?",
    "80BBF34D": "Come on in, Guardian.",
    "80BBF34F": "What can Holliday do for ya?",
    "80BBF351": "Lookin' for something new?",
    "80BBF353": "Let's get you flyin' again.",
    "80BBF355": "Just ask, Guardian. I got your back.",
    "80BBF357": "New hangar, new specs. Check 'em out.",
    "80BBF359": "You and I both know you deserve a new ship. Right?",
    "80BBF35B": "You been down to the City lately? It'd be good. See what you're fighting for.",
    "80BBF35D": "Heck of a day.",
    "80BBF35F": "Here's what I got.",
    "80BBF361": "Aaand here we go.",
    "80BBF363": "Yeah?",
    "80BBF365": "New wings, no waitin'.",
    "80BBF367": "What's up?",
    "80BBF369": "Do somethin' for ya?",
    "80BBF36B": "What ya lookin' for?",
    "80BBF36D": "Hey there.",
    "80BBF36F": "Yup, yup, yup. Let's talk.",
    "80BBF371": "Hey there, big shot.",
    "80BBF373": "For you, anything. What's up?",
    "80BBF375": "It's you! Hey!",
    "80BBF377": "Treat yourself, hero.",
    "80F5D6DE": "Happy Festival of the Lost!",
    "80F5D6DF": "Scare anybody this festival?",
    "80F5D6E1": "Interest you in anything spooky?",
    "80BBF379": "Smelly space rhinos think they can come to my planet and mess up the place? No, sir.",
    "80BBF37B": "Shop quick and get back out there. Don't let up.",
    "80BBF37D": "The Cabal fly hard. We're gonna fly harder. Move!",
    "80BBF37F": "Keep fightin' the good fight, Guardian.",
    "80BBF381": "Fleet took a beatin'. Lotta ships to work on. Not a lot of time, here.",
    "80BBF383": "There's no way we're gonna be outflown by those Legion tubs, Guardian.",
    "80BBF385": "New ships, fresh from the shipyards. Why wait?",
    "80BBF387": "Just finished workin' on that.",
    "80BBF389": "Hope you like it.",
    "80BBF38B": "Take good care of it.",
    "80BBF38D": "Treat her right, she'll treat you right.",
    "80BBF38F": "Lemme know how it turns out.",
    "80BBF391": "Hope it keeps you safe!",
    "80BBF393": "Gonna look great.",
    "80BBF395": "Remember to read the instructions!",
    "80BBF397": "Now that's a good choice.",
    "80BBF399": "You know your stuff.",
    "80BBF39B": "Ooh, jealous. ",
    "80BBF39D": "Custom job, in-house.",
    "80BBF39F": "Not too many of these out there.",
    "80BBF3A1": "Just got that workin', too.",
    "80BBF3A3": "That was a pleasure to work on.",
    "80BBF3A5": "Stay low, move fast, fly straight.",
    "80BBF3A7": "'Til next time, Guardian.",
    "80BBF3A9": "Take care of yourself, hear?",
    "80BBF3AB": "Thanks, Guardian.",
    "80BBF3AD": "Good luck out there.",
    "80BBF3AF": "Keep your knife sharp, friend.",
    "80BBF3B1": "Watch where you step, yeah?",
    "80BBF3B3": "Keep your back to the wall, Guardian.",
    "80BBF3B5": "Stay strong, Titan.",
    "80BBF3B7": "Don't die angry, Warlock!",
    "80BBF3B9": "Feel the universe! Or whatever. OK?",
    "80C92857": "I have a little task that might interest you, Guardian.",
    "80C9285B": "I'd hoped you would be by.",
    "80C9285C": "Perhaps we can help each other, Guardian.",
    "80C9285E": "Dead Orbit requires your assistance.",
    "80C9285F": "A situation has come to my attention that we could use your help with.",
    "80C92860": "We need to talk.",
    "80C92861": "Do you have a moment, Guardian?",
    "80C92863": "Another story for your legend, Guardian. It will be told long after we are gone.",
    "80C92865": "Ah yes, there you are.",
    "80C92866": "If you can see beyond my appearance to the cold, black truth of things, then Dead Orbit is the place for you.",
    "80C92867": "You seem curious.",
    "80C92869": "Do I repel you? This planet should repel you—it is our doom. Come with us. We can save you.",
    "80C9286A": "Indeed, I am scarred. Deeper than the eye can see, in some ways.",
    "80C9286B": "Dead Orbit has lost much in this war. But there is always more that can be lost.",
    "80C9286C": "If you are not here to help, then let me return to my plans.",
    "80C9286D": "Ready to say goodbye to this dying world?",
    "80C9286F": "How long before another strikes at our heart?",
    "80C92870": "You have done what you can in this system, Guardian. Is it not time to venture beyond?",
    "80C92872": "Do not mistake our deliberation for complacency, Guardian.",
    "80C92874": "Humanity depends on you.",
    "80C92875": "Surely you yearn for distant star systems as much as I do. As we speak, our ships are being readied.",
    "80C92876": "Dead Orbit may be the poorest of the factions, since we pour our wealth into ships and settlement supplies, but we reward our followers as best we can.",
    "80C92877": "Dead Orbit brings hope to those who have lost it. So do you. We are alike in that way.",
    "80C92878": "Your skills would be invaluable to Dead Orbit. And Dead Orbit, I believe, can be invaluable to you.",
    "80C92879": "Do you also believe our future lies beyond the stars?",
    "80C9287A": "Dead Orbit believes in you.",
    "80C9287B": "Dead Orbit cares not whether you are Earthborn or Reefborn.",
    "80C9287D": "Would you like to hear more about Dead Orbit, Guardian?",
    "80C9287F": "Do you wonder that we're still here? Most of our ships were destroyed in the Red Legion's assault. Our repairs go slowly.",
    "80C92880": "Stay put then. Here in the Tower, on Earth. Dead Orbit will not wait for you to move.",
    "80C92881": "How does one become an Arach, you wonder? I will tell you. In the depths of despair, another Arach finds you.",
    "80C92882": "My faith is in humanity and Guardians, not the Traveler. Is that so strange?",
    "80C92883": "Why do you stare at me? Have you never seen a man who has lost everything?",
    "80C92885": "I tell you, the Traveler drew the Red Legion here, like moths to a flame!",
    "80C92886": "What can we do for each other?",
    "80C92887": "There is not much time.",
    "80C92888": "You wonder: will we ever leave? Will we ever be ready? Sometimes I wonder, too.",
    "80C92889": "I look forward to leaving this world to the Fallen once we're gone.",
    "80C9288A": "What storms may come, we'll ride out together.",
    "80C9288B": "Dead Orbit takes care of those loyal to it.",
    "80C9288C": "What you do on this planet affects us all.",
    "80C9288D": "Are you looking to buy some time?",
    "80C9288E": "Do not take this lightly.",
    "80C9288F": "Look at this Tower! Isn't it everything you've ever dreamed of?",
    "80C92890": "Celebrate our victory with us. Together, we have strengthened the City. More importantly, we have strengthened Dead Orbit.",
    "80C92891": "Have you come to share our triumph? All are welcome.",
    "80C92892": "The Consensus came down here! To me! To honor us, they said.",
    "80C92893": "Join us. Today we celebrate! Yes, even Dead Orbit knows how to throw a party.",
    "80C92894": "Today we rejoice. Tomorrow we prepare for departure.",
    "80C92895": "You like to survive, Hunter. So do we.",
    "80C92897": "Will you come with us to the stars, Hunter?",
    "80C92899": "Dead Orbit wants what you want, Hunter: new horizons. ",
    "80C9289B": "Strength attracts strength, Titan. Surely that is why you are here.",
    "80C9289D": "Will you lend your strength to Dead Orbit, Titan?",
    "80C9289F": "Protect what is here, Titan. But be ready for what is next.",
    "80C928A1": "It seems your wisdom has led you to us, Warlock.",
    "80C928A3": "Dead Orbit seeks knowledge too, Warlock. What have you seen?",
    "80C928A5": "Perhaps the answers you seek don't exist, Warlock. Perhaps we're not asking the right questions.",
    "80C928A7": "I for one will not be sorry when we leave Lakshmi and the Cult behind. We will establish a colony of peace, and war will be forgotten.",
    "80C928A8": "Let Lakshmi gloat! We will find another way to refit our ships, and then this will all be meaningless.",
    "80C928A9": "The buckets of money spent on turning this Tower purple could have bought supplies for the people!",
    "80C928AA": "Future War Cult has triumphed. The City is headed for endless war. Truly, the stars have gone dark.",
    "80C928AB": "Ah, despair, my good friend. Has Lakshmi sent you?",
    "80C928AC": "Lakshmi's laughter pierces any helmet. I've tried them all.",
    "80C928AD": "They're a war cult. What would they know of relief work? Pah.",
    "80C928AE": "As soon as that jumped-up little guttersnipe got her hands on Future War Cult's prediction engine, she started talking and dressing as if she was born important. But some of us remember who she really was.",
    "80C928AF": "If the City only knew who they praised",
    "80C928B0": "Lakshmi and her minions have won over the Consensus for now, but this is not the end.",
    "80C928B1": "Tell Amanda we need her work on our ships expedited. There's no escape until those are repaired.",
    "80C928B2": "Forward half of all supplies to the refugee camps but retain any scrap collected for our ship repairs.",
    "80C928B3": "No one should grow up in fear.",
    "80C928B4": "It’s not for our sake, but for those who will be born on better worlds.",
    "80C928B5": "War will always come to the City. We must find a home free from war.",
    "80C928B6": "Attachments bind us to this place. We must be free.",
    "80C928B7": "The Red Legion is broken. Now we must prepare.",
    "80C928B8": "This is where humanity began, but it will not end here.",
    "80C928B9": "Why do we linger in that European Dead Zone?",
    "80C928BA": "The way is cleared. Now we must go forward.",
    "80C928BB": "Let the Monarchists rest on their laurels. We shall prove the truth to all, next time. Or the time after that. And if we do not well. It will not be Dead Orbit that falls.",
    "80C928BC": "Hideo has always been an opportunist. When we were children, a box fell off a cart in our neighborhood. Next minute, he's selling us all the candy from that box.",
    "80C928BD": "New Monarchy grows overconfident. What will they do now, I wonder? Stage a coup? Crown Zavala?",
    "80C928BE": "Triumph and joy are not familiar feelings. We have lost nothing, truly. And perhaps victory would have softened us.",
    "80C928BF": "We put down our weapons and ended the Faction Wars for this?",
    "80C928C0": "We put down our weapons and ended the Faction Rallies for this?",
    "80C928C1": "Hideo makes me wonder why we ever made peace with the other factions. In some ways, I preferred fighting in the streets. It was more honest.",
    "80C928C2": "He must have rigged the competition, greased some palms. He is Hideo, after all.",
    "80C928C3": "The color of blood covers the City. Is it an omen?",
    "80C928C4": "Let Hideo prattle of obsolete systems of governance. Our history is free of such illusions. We mourn all that we lost, then forge forward.",
    "80C928C5": "This must not be the end. We have much to do.",
    "80C928C6": "Triumph is intoxicating. I could almost forget our mission. I could almost forget the dying stars.",
    "80C928C7": "We will let the others join us, if they beg. That's fair, isn't it?",
    "80C928C8": "We have prevailed, after a long struggle. After enormous personal sacrifice. Surely the City will see the truth now.",
    "80C928C9": "We are magnanimous in victory. Distribute extra rations and offer our armaments to all. Together, we shall survive.",
    "80C928CA": "A bittersweet victory. The City honors us, and we remain earthbound.",
    "80C928CB": "At long last, the City bows to us. But is it too late?",
    "80C928CC": "See how they recognize us now! See how they believe!",
    "80C928CD": "Back when the factions still fought, I imagined the City might look like this someday. But the people I wanted to see this they are gone.",
    "80C928CE": "Perhaps more will follow us to our new home and be saved, now that we've proven ourselves honorable, honest, and strong.",
    "80C928CF": "We expect a wave of recruits in the wake of this victory. Bring them up to speed on Dead Orbit's bitter struggle for legitimacy, our outbound courses, and our preparations for exodus.",
    "80C928D0": "I suppose we can humor the Consensus, for the moment.",
    "80C928D1": "I know the mettle of the Arachs and those sworn to Dead Orbit. Grief and loss drive every one of us. We shall win.",
    "80C928D2": "If I had Guardians as brave as these, back when the factions fought in the streets, well let's just say the City would look different today.",
    "80C928D3": "The Consensus will not be able to dismiss us any longer, once they see our true might.",
    "80C928D4": "Supply dockets, inventories, bills of lading—I will be buried beneath all this paperwork!",
    "80C928D5": "Do you hear the stars?",
    "80C928D6": "Do not despair.",
    "80C928D7": "There is yet time.",
    "80C928D8": "None of us are safe here.",
    "80C928D9": "Are you prepared?",
    "80C928DB": "Let us work together.",
    "80C928DC": "So glad you have come.",
    "80C928DD": "Welcome back.",
    "80C9295B": "How can we help each other?",
    "80C9295C": "Guardian!",
    "80C9295E": "Of course you're interested in survival. Who isn't?",
    "80C9295F": "Dead Orbit is no fair-weather friend.",
    "80C92961": "Your deeds are well known, Guardian. Dead Orbit could use your talents.",
    "80C9296E": "I wish to remember Earth at its most beautiful, when we leave it behind.",
    "80C9296F": "You continue to search this world; why, I do not know.",
    "80C92970": "We'll see to it you are richly rewarded.",
    "80C92974": "See, Dead Orbit can be generous.",
    "80C92975": "There will be a place on our ships for you.",
    "80C92978": "If this City follows Future War Cult and that charlatan, it charts a course to disaster. I know better than anyone where Lakshmi's schemes lead.",
    "80C9297A": "Lakshmi likes to say that I see things in black and white. Better than your endless riddles, I said. You can draw a map in black and white.",
    "80C9297B": "Earth broke my heart, long ago. It will break Lakshmi's as well.",
    "80C9297F": "Unlike Lakshmi, I remember my roots. I know where I came from, and all the dinginess, filth, and misery of that place. I know where I am. And I know where I will go.",
    "80C92981": "A minor setback. Still, we do not need the support of the Consensus to continue repairs on our ships.",
    "80C92982": "What I wouldn't give to wipe the triumphant smirk off Hideo's face.",
    "80C92984": "New Monarchy hasn't mocked us in days. They're too busy reveling in their victory and paying the bribes they promised.",
    "80C92987": "Red and white everywhere it looks like a massacre. I have seen so many",
    "80C92988": "So New Monarchy is in the ascendant. What does it matter? We will leave for new horizons, and they will stay mired in the past.",
    "80C92989": "Kings and Queens—pah. They rise and fall. What matters are the explorers who sail off the edges of the map to find new homes.",
    "80C9298A": "We wear the black and white to represent both destruction and rebirth. And now the City wears it too.",
    "80C9298C": "This is how the City should always look. Bleak. Forbidding. Not at all like home.",
    "80C9298E": "Now that we've proven our worth, Guardians will flock to us. And after the Guardians join us, the Vanguard. And after the Vanguard, the City. We will save them all.",
    "80C9298F": "The Consensus has seen what we are capable of. Soon they will believe us, too.",
    "80C92990": "This triumph brings Dead Orbit closer to our glorious departure. Wait and see.",
    "80C92992": "If the City had listened to us, we would have been safe. Elsewhere.",
    "80C92993": "No one—not the other factions, not the Consensus—thinks as much about the future of our children as we do. If they had, my sons would still be alive.",
    "80C92994": "It's not too late to seek a newer world.",
    "80C92995": "Perhaps we could use these new discoveries as a stage for outsystem flights?",
    "80C92996": "The Red Legion is scattered, but not defeated. This system is still not safe.",
    "80C92998": "Your victory will not last forever, Guardian. Dead Orbit knows what comes next.",
    "80C9299B": "Your victory against the Red Legion has bought this planet time, Guardian. No more.",
    "80C9299E": "Do not be anchored to the place of your birth.",
    "80C929FE": "The warmth of our sun is an illusion, Guardian. Do not fall under its spell.",
    "80C92A00": "You can reclaim humanity's past, Guardian. We will look to our future.",
    "80C92AC7": "Many years ago, Dead Orbit took me in. They gave me a home. They gave me a vision. They gave me the truth.",
    "80C92AF4": "Join us! We will show you victory, and then the stars.",
    "80C92B43": "Of course we'll win. Do you think Hideo or Lakshmi know anything about scavenging and surviving? I have spent my whole life as a scavenger and survivor.",
    "80C93200": "You know you're meant for Dead Orbit when you feel a longing for other places and other stars.",
    "80C93256": "Do you dream of other worlds? Dead Orbit will take you there.",
    "80C93257": "Today, we struggle to survive and rebuild. Tomorrow, we launch.",
    "80C93258": "A piece of Dead Orbit. Treasure it.",
    "80C93259": "Good. Take it.",
    "80C9325A": "You need it more than us.",
    "80C9325B": "May it guide you on whatever path you follow.",
    "80C932BA": "One fewer thing to weigh us down.",
    "80C932BB": "Take it with our thanks.",
    "80C932BC": "That design is unique to our technicians.",
    "80C932BD": "For our future.",
    "80C932BE": "That's been thoroughly tested.",
    "80C932CC": "A wise choice.",
    "80C932CF": "You won't find better than that.",
    "80C932E5": "One of Dead Orbit's treasures.",
    "80C932E6": "Now you see the benefit in supporting Dead Orbit.",
    "80C932E7": "Do not lose that. We sacrificed much to give it to you.",
    "80C932E8": "I don't remember authorizing this for sale",
    "80C932E9": "Use it to keep the Darkness at bay.",
    "80C932EA": "Farewell.",
    "80C932EB": "Until we meet again. And we will.",
    "80C932EC": "May your travels be safe, Guardian.",
    "80C932EE": "Do not hesitate to call on us.",
    "80C932EF": "Report back when you can.",
    "80C932F1": "Watch the skies, Hunter.",
    "80C932F3": "Keep your eyes on the horizon.",
    "80C932F4": "You will be our pillar when we rebuild.",
    "80C932F5": "Your strength is our strength, Titan.",
    "80C932F7": "Your counsel is always welcome, Warlock.",
    "80C932F9": "May you find what you seek.",
    "80C932FB": "We waste time on frivolity. We should look to the sky, not the ground under our Sparrows.",
    "80C932FC": "If you must race, make sure you defeat New Monarchy.",
    "80C932FD": "Dead Orbit is pleased to support future racing events. Let the next one be on a planet we have not yet discovered.",
    "80C932FE": "The cold brings us together. The cold drives us to action.",
    "80C932FF": "Snow and ice suit this place.",
    "80C93300": "Winter reminds us of Earth's ultimate fate: cold, barren, lifeless.",
    "80C93301": "We must remember those we have lost... and then move on.",
    "80C93302": "There must be tastier candy among the stars.",
    "80C93303": "Let us honor our lost by carrying their memories into the stars!",
    "80C93304": "Do not grow complacent. This season is not ours.",
    "80C93305": "Who is to say there are not better worlds out there? With warmer, lovelier summers?",
    "80C93306": "You have been to the Lighthouse! It will be a shame to leave such a place behind.",
    "80C93307": "The Lighthouse, eh? I have not the skill to go to such a place.",
    "80C93308": "What can you see from the Lighthouse? A way out?",
    "80C93309": "I have never been to the outpost at the Reef. I fear I would not leave.",
    "80C9330A": "Guardian. Did you see Petra in your travels?",
    "80C9330C": "Is the Reef sympathetic to Dead Orbit's cause?",
    "80C9330D": "As the new season blooms, Guardian, so does our resolve.",
    "80C9330F": "Earth's weather is beautiful, true. But what of other worlds?",
    "80C93310": "There is strength in our bonds, Guardian.",
    "80C93312": "I have forgotten what it is like to be close.",
    "80C93313": "The Crimson Days celebrate what we cannot achieve alone. Cooperation. Civilization. Reproduction.",
    "80C93314": "Celebrate the Light, yes. But as a guide, not a destination.",
    "80C93315": "Another year on Earth. How many remain?",
    "80C93316": "An arbitrary holiday based on the orbit of a dying planet",
    "80C93317": "I could tell you a story about a broken City and a cult prepared for war But you've heard that one, Guardian.",
    "80C9331B": "Are you looking for a glimpse of the terrible, wonderful future? Does that attract you?",
    "80C9331C": "Welcome, slayer of Ghaul. I see so many timelines converging upon you.",
    "80C9331E": "Future War Cult contains circles upon circles. What will you do to enter them?",
    "80C9331F": "The only thing you need to know about me is that my predictions were correct. War came. We were vindicated.",
    "80C93320": "You can't just come in close and expect an invitation to the Inner Circle. That's not how it works.",
    "80C93321": "Come, Guardian. Join us. Ready this city for the next war.",
    "80C93323": "Future War Cult is selective in recruiting, but you—you would make the cut.",
    "80C93325": "You look like one whose will bends timelines. Would you care to try?",
    "80C93326": "They say you are a hero. Prove it.",
    "80C93328": "Only the wise can glimpse the future. Only the brave can face what they see there. Is that you?",
    "80C9332A": "Will you be our sword?",
    "80C9332B": "What do you think you will learn about Future War Cult by standing there? (laughs)",
    "80C9332D": "Ah, no, the time for me to tell stories is over. War has come, and it demands my complete attention.",
    "80C9332E": "She has been silent for so long. No one has seen her in years. But I have faith.",
    "80C9332F": "You stare and say nothing, Guardian. Are you foolish, I wonder, or truly wise?",
    "80C93331": "A Guardian at rest, between stories. What an unusual sight.",
    "80C93333": "You are powerful, Guardian. A shame your body won't handle temporal stress",
    "80C93335": "Tell me what I can do for you, Guardian. The future slips by like a river.",
    "80C93337": "Loitering won't get you to the Inner Circle, Guardian.",
    "80C93339": "The time to act is now, Guardian.",
    "80C9333B": "What can we do together, I wonder?",
    "80C9333C": "The future needs you.",
    "80C9333D": "You wear the dust of war, Guardian.",
    "80C9333F": "I see the scars of time and war.",
    "80C93340": "What do you think of Future War Cult now, hm?",
    "80C93341": "We have won. Now we bring a new vision to this City. Forget the dark past and where you've come from. The future shall be brutal and glorious.",
    "80C93342": "Did you think victory would oil my jaw and cause me to speak openly of secrets? I am sorry to disappoint.",
    "80C93344": "Behold the City as it should be. As it will be.",
    "80C93345": "Guardian! I see a little of your future as it forks—and the path to victory is with us.",
    "80C93346": "I've seen Hunters cut through braided timelines to a single gleaming future. I don't know how you do it.",
    "80C93347": "Hunter, have you learned to use secrets like knives? Did you want to learn?",
    "80C93349": "You don't need to do this alone, Hunter. The War Cult is here.",
    "80C9334B": "You are a war unto yourself, Titan. I admire that.",
    "80C9334D": "Titan, a warrior like you understands the glory of struggle.",
    "80C9334F": "Titan, how does the prospect of infinite wars sound to you?",
    "80C93351": "Warlock, a mind like yours might penetrate the fog that hides the future. Would you like to try?",
    "80C93353": "I find Warlocks most suited to understanding our subtle mysteries.",
    "80C93355": "I trade in words yet to be written, Warlock.",
    "80C93357": "That damp rag of an Arach thinks he can escape an inescapable future. War will follow his sad ships wherever they go. Our philosophy could prepare him, but is he interested? Ha.",
    "80C93358": "In another timeline, Dead Orbit lost and we won. A poor consolation.",
    "80C93359": "What I wouldn't give for a little color around here.",
    "80C9335A": "While the Arachs are distracted, we will consolidate our influence among the lesser players. Sound them out.",
    "80C9335B": "However many points Jalaal scores in these trivial contests, the truth does not change. War WILL return to this City. The Consensus WILL turn back to Future War Cult.",
    "80C9335C": "So the Consensus has let Jalaal pull the wool over their eyes. That is their problem, not mine.",
    "80C9335D": "Jalaal, a victor? (laughter) I have not heard a joke this good in a long, long time.",
    "80C9335E": "Dead Orbit thinks they offer the best chance at survival. Ha! Future War Cult prepares the City for war—and for victory!",
    "80C9335F": "Let Dead Orbit gather a few gullible Guardians and fly out of this system. It wouldn't be a loss.",
    "80C93360": "This city looks like it's mourning, not celebrating. I suppose that is appropriate.",
    "80C93361": "Let the Monarchists have their little party. War is coming. War is always coming.",
    "80C93362": "Hideo is so very focused on the present. He misses the futures flowing and ebbing around us.",
    "80C93363": "In another timeline, this Tower is red with flame, not cloth. Will we be ready when that timeline bends back to this one, I wonder?",
    "80C93364": "The Tower has turned the color of blood. New Monarchy is more prescient than they know.",
    "80C93365": "If, like Hideo, I had lost a sibling in the Red War, perhaps I too would fixate on the trifles of the present moment.",
    "80C93366": "New Monarchy can enjoy their trifling honors. Zavala still consults with us quietly, when no one can see.",
    "80C93367": "Crowns can be dangerous. I have seen the bloody consequences, both in the past and in what is to come.",
    "80C93368": "When your faction has experienced losses on so many other fronts, who am I to begrudge them a small victory?",
    "80C93369": "We will integrate this data, run our simulations, and improve our hypotheses so that next time we do not lose.",
    "80C9336A": "I remember when Hideo crawled out of the wreckage, weeping, having lost everything that mattered I do not think he has forgotten. Even with all this.",
    "80C9336B": "Of course Future War Cult will win. This has never been in doubt.",
    "80C9336C": "Which wise Guardians will pledge to our cause and know victory, I wonder?",
    "80C9336D": "Ah, the rewards that we shall offer, when we prove victorious. Honor. A place in the cult. Weapons deadly beyond imagination.",
    "80C9336E": "I would be more certain of victory if we had not lost so many loyal soldiers in the War. An inevitable price, and yet I begin to feel regret.",
    "80C9336F": "To walk among refugees is to feel their terror. A heavy feeling, like drowning. No good future can come from that. Perhaps we can help.",
    "80C93370": "If we teach the refugees how to fight and survive, how to make new futures, perhaps they will be less afraid.",
    "80C93371": "This time, you see, we will take the war to them. Our enemies will not be able to hurt the City then.",
    "80C93372": "When we have implemented the Pleiades Strategy, we will not need to fuss around with enemy supply crates. You'll see.",
    "80C93373": "Future War Cult has always extended a hand to the destitute. We advertise for volunteer test subjects and pay them handsomely.",
    "80C93374": "Good. Very good.",
    "80C93375": "We have never lacked for postulants, but our victory has brought a flood. Some are worthy. Some are not.",
    "80C93376": "Remember when they laughed at us? What do you think they say now?",
    "80C93377": "Isn’t it lovely how a little proof brings great success? Half the City’s clamoring to join the cult now.",
    "80C93378": "(laughter) 'But what does Future War Cult think?' the Consensus asks. About time!",
    "80C93379": "We are gracious in triumph. Let all contenders know a little of our bounty and mystery.",
    "80C9337A": "We have secured the goodwill of the Consensus. The Pleiades Strategy continues on schedule.",
    "80C9337B": "A little triumph goes a long way. All the way to Ikora's ears. She was here earlier, asking questions. About what? Oho, that is a secret",
    "80C9337C": "Oddly, confirmation of our predictions is the least exciting outcome. We were right. We won. Hmm.",
    "80C9337D": "The levers of power are in our hands. Now we must find plausible candidates, without clear affiliation to Future War Cult, to pull them.",
    "80C9337E": "A few supplies, one or two undiscovered secrets, the destruction of a handful of enemy assets—from such stones do we build victory.",
    "80C9337F": "We must create the future we hope to see. And creation is a violent business.",
    "80C93380": "In a million other timelines, the City is destroyed by Vex, or Fallen, or Taken, or Hive. What's constant is the struggle.",
    "80C93381": "Reality maps precisely to a set of complex mathematical models still unknown to us. We glimpse parts of it, now and then, and solve what we can.",
    "80C93382": "Half of the Inner Circle vanished during the Red War. We did not predict their deaths, so they must still be alive. Somewhere.",
    "80C93383": "A long time ago, I looked into the flames of war and saw a branching future. There would be war, always, but what we chose to do that choice mattered. We could cultivate beautiful futures, or hideous ones.",
    "80C93384": "Do tell.",
    "80C93385": "Anything of note?",
    "80C93386": "We pay well for data.",
    "80C93387": "I await your information.",
    "80C93388": "Do you have a story to tell me?",
    "80C93389": "Hmm?",
    "80C9338A": "Subtle. Very subtle.",
    "80C9338B": "Are you ready, Guardian?",
    "80C9338D": "Our timelines intersect again.",
    "80C9338E": "Come to help us?",
    "80C9338F": "Good, you're here. Then so is the war.",
    "80C93390": "We meet again.",
    "80C93391": "I look forward to the stories you will bring us.",
    "80C93392": "The Future War Cult welcomes you.",
    "80C93393": "You are an unpredictable variable in every simulation we run, Guardian.",
    "80C93395": "Let's see what you can do with this timeline.",
    "80C93396": "Future War Cult has seen what you can do.",
    "80C93397": "You fight for the future. Good.",
    "80C93398": "In your hands, the future is safe. Relatively.",
    "80C93399": "A message of despair may win out, for a time. A lasting victory requires us to prepare for endless war.",
    "80C9339A": "It is a good thing we take the long view of temporality. Otherwise, I might have felt discouraged.",
    "80C9339B": "The fault was in our predictions, not in those loyal to us.",
    "80C9339C": "The Arachs celebrate their victory, and I celebrate our conversion of two New Monarchists and an Executor to our cause.",
    "80C9339D": "I have experienced greater losses, in the Red War. Brothers and sisters, whose futures were projected. Certain. Compared to that, this is nothing.",
    "80C9339E": "Bah, this loss is a trifle. We have acquired valuable data for our prediction engines. That is more important.",
    "80C9339F": "Hideo can be so charmingly enthusiastic.",
    "80C933A0": "Is that the sound of New Monarchists celebrating that I hear? Ironic.",
    "80C933A1": "This outcome indicates an anomaly in the timeline. We must investigate and integrate this reality into what is postulated. And then we must pull the timeline back to its proper path.",
    "80C933A2": "Oh Hideo, Hideo, such unnecessary griefs are yours. If only you had joined us—we would have taught your sister to protect herself.",
    "80C933A3": "Those who see truly, without distortion, will look through all this frippery to what lies beneath. An empty puppet, a glum drip of oil, and a soldier, readying herself for war.",
    "80C933A4": "A few ribbons, a compliment, a handful of baubles, and the New Monarchists lose their minds.",
    "80C933A5": "There was a time, during the Red War, when Hideo and Jalaal and I worked sleeplessly on rescue and relief missions, side by side. It seems that sense of unity is gone.",
    "80C933A6": "This victory confirms the accuracy of our simulation parameters.",
    "80C933A7": "Our hypotheses were correct. We defended the City. The Consensus glorifies us. And yet I still long for another future I still wish to see her.",
    "80C933A8": "Once, I walked a lonely path, friendless and unwanted, dreaming of such a day as this.",
    "80C933A9": "Vindication is indeed satisfying. We felt thus when the Red Legion came, and we feel it again now.",
    "80C933AA": "Look at how our victory has caused this Tower to bloom!",
    "80C933AB": "Refugees, refugees, refugees. Of course we'll serve them. Convert them. Bring them into the mysteries. But only the worthy ones.",
    "80C933AC": "I understand them better than you might think. Long ago, I too was flotsam from a brutal war. Future War Cult found me. Now I can do the same for others.",
    "80C933AD": "The Consensus believes we can steal a march on our enemies by destroying their supplies. This is true, but it also lacks ambition.",
    "80C933AE": "They speak of ancient treasures recently unearthed by landslides and weathering, waiting for claimants of course the Consensus wants a cut. But they've promised a share to the finders as well.",
    "80C933AF": "Great things can come out of competitive spirit. Once, we competed to design the most accurate simulations of the local multiverse. I foresaw a bloody battle, which came to pass, and won. That was the beginning.",
    "80C933B0": "The Tower may fall. The City may fall. Future War Cult shall endure.",
    "80C933B1": "They should have listened to us. Too bad. (laughs)",
    "80C933B2": "New Monarchy and Dead Orbit tell charming tales for children. Our stories are war stories.",
    "80C933B3": "A million timelines woven into each other, some spiraling, some tangling, and the needle of the Future War Cult pierces them all.",
    "80C933B4": "We observed, and we prepared, and on the day war came to this City, we saved many.",
    "80C933B5": "It's been postulated that our interrogation of time might attract unwanted attention, from other dimensions. It's quite exciting.",
    "80C933B6": "The City's fate is continued conflict. We knew this.",
    "80C933B7": "Everything can be a weapon in our war.",
    "80C933B8": "Take it. Fight for the future.",
    "80C933B9": "Use it well. War Cult is counting on you.",
    "80C933BA": "Take this and fight for War Cult, Guardian.",
    "80C933BC": "This is yours. War Cult predicts great success from you.",
    "80C933BD": "Whatever best equips you for war.",
    "80C933BE": "Take that to battle. You'll do well.",
    "80C933BF": "Ours is not an easy war. Perhaps this will help.",
    "80C933C0": "Every small advantage helps.",
    "80C933C1": "War Cult hopes you use this well.",
    "80C933C2": "Take this, and the war, to the stars.",
    "80C933C3": "This will aid you in your fight.",
    "80C933C4": "We need you, Guardian. And you need this.",
    "80C933C6": "May this help you return intact.",
    "80C933C8": "War Cult takes care of its operatives.",
    "80C933C9": "May this serve you well.",
    "80C933CA": "A challenge for you, Guardian. Or perhaps it is a riddle.",
    "80C933CC": "We never forget those who assist us. Not in a million timelines.",
    "80C933CD": "Generosity to Future War Cult is repaid many times over.",
    "80C933CE": "Did curiosity or desire bring you? Either way, we have a task for you.",
    "80C933CF": "We need you. Will you help us?",
    "80C933D0": "You have fighting spirit. You'll need it.",
    "80C933D2": "Until time bends and brings you back, Guardian.",
    "80C933D4": "Come back with another story.",
    "80C933D5": "Represent us well, Guardian. ",
    "80C933D7": "Take our war to the stars, Guardian.",
    "80C933D9": "And so you return to war. Be well.",
    "80C933DB": "May all your timelines be bright, Hunter.",
    "80C933DD": "Go swiftly into war, Hunter.",
    "80C933DF": "War is the place for you, Titan. Be well.",
    "80C933E0": "May you triumph in all your wars, Titan.",
    "80C933E2": "I see battle in your future, Warlock. Go bravely.",
    "80C933E4": "Until we meet again, in futures yet to be simulated.",
    "80C933E5": "I can't begin to count those who've passed.",
    "80C933E6": "War Cult knows exactly what we've lost. No need to celebrate it.",
    "80C933E7": "Future War Cult would undo what we've lost.",
    "80C933E8": "Seasons can change, but War Cult will always be here.",
    "80C933E9": "Can you fight in this heat? You'll have to.",
    "80C933EB": "Bear this heat as you would any other pain.",
    "80C933EC": "Spring has come, and there's no weather but war.",
    "80C933ED": "There's levity in the air. I don't trust it.",
    "80C933EE": "Spring will always arrive, whether we have or not.",
    "80C933EF": "Have you found a partner yet? Time slips by.",
    "80C933F0": "Secrets of War Cult won't help you select a Crimson Bond.",
    "80C933F1": "A broken heart is not the end, Guardian.",
    "80C933F3": "As expected, another Dawn has come.",
    "80C933F4": "To new beginnings. Not that we haven't already seen them.",
    "80C933F5": "The Dawning is here.",
    "80C933F6": "How do the Reefborn fare? ",
    "80C933F7": "The simulations paint a grim picture for the Reefborn.",
    "80C933F8": "Petra and her Reefborn play at politics, too, Guardian, make no mistake.",
    "80C933FA": "You've been to the Lighthouse. I can see the sparks. Future War Cult will be watching.",
    "80C933FC": "You've reached the Lighthouse. Remarkable.",
    "80C933FD": "The Lighthouse? Shaxx must respect you.",
    "80C933FE": "The War Cult will find the best riders. Anything to further the cause.",
    "80C933FF": "Throw caution to the wind. Your race is already determined.",
    "80C93400": "Fear is the greatest threat to a rider's outcome.",
    "80C93401": "If the simulations are right, cold is the least of our worries.",
    "80C93402": "These temperatures are bad for my chassis.",
    "80C93403": "It's cold.",
    "80C93404": "New Monarchy puts its hope in you.",
    "80C93407": "New Monarchy holds you in high confidence. Can you help us?",
    "80C93408": "I'm looking for Guardians who are up for a challenge.",
    "80C93409": "I could use your help, friend.",
    "80C9340B": "Let's work together.",
    "80C9340C": "We have something that only a Guardian can handle.",
    "80C9340E": "I know you're up to the challenge, Guardian.",
    "80C93410": "Up for a challenge, friend?",
    "80C93412": "Let's put your skills to the test.",
    "80C93413": "I will fight to protect my home. There is no other place for me. No other planet, no other answer.",
    "80C93414": "The best decisions are made by one person. Ruler, monarch, leader—whatever title you like.",
    "80C93415": "When a ruler came calling, he razed the City. We need a ruler of our own, to protect it.",
    "80C93416": "The Red Legion left us in disarray because we had no single strong leader. We need one now more than ever.",
    "80C93417": "I told them we needed unity and leadership. I told them. They didn’t listen.",
    "80C93418": "We were scattered to the corners of the system because no one had the authority to rally us.",
    "80C93419": "Of course I'm in touch with my feelings. How else could I lead?",
    "80C9341A": "Our purpose remains. We will unite this city.",
    "80C9341B": "New Monarchy is here for you, Guardian.",
    "80C9341D": "There will be a new Golden Age—here, in this city. New Monarchy will see to it.",
    "80C9341E": "How can New Monarchy help you, Guardian?",
    "80C93420": "Guardian. New Monarchy offers hope for the City.",
    "80C93422": "You look like an honorable Guardian. One who seeks the good of the City above all. New Monarchy is the the place for you.",
    "80C93424": "How many other factions feed the poor in this city, Guardian?",
    "80C93426": "Others have criticized our wealth, but it is our wealth that lets us give back, generously, without stinting, to those who need it most.",
    "80C93427": "New Monarchy will win. Of that I am sure. But will you choose the winning side?",
    "80C93428": "You remind me of the kings and queens in our salvaged history. The good ones, I mean.",
    "80C93429": "New Monarchy has much to offer.",
    "80C9342A": "Willing to join the New Monarchy, Guardian?",
    "80C9342C": "Will you aid us in our endeavors, Guardian?",
    "80C9342E": "The New Monarchy requests your favor, Guardian.",
    "80C93430": "New Monarchy has a need for your talents, Guardian.",
    "80C93432": "All things change if we wait long enough. From war to peace. From weakness to strength. From chaos to order. And this—our home—this is the place to wait.",
    "80C93433": "Our quarters are comfortable, aren't they? Please, enjoy yourself. I know Guardians don't get much rest.",
    "80C93434": "You seem quite relaxed, Guardian. That's good. It's important for our leaders to have confidence.",
    "80C93436": "While you're standing there—what do Zavala and Ikora think of New Monarchy?",
    "80C93437": "Oh, no, I would never forget about you. New Monarchy pays close attention to those with promise.",
    "80C93438": "Are you waiting for an opportunity, Guardian? If there's one thing I've learned, it's that you make your own opportunities.",
    "80C9343A": "There is no better time than the present, and no better place than where you are—a lesson neither Lakshmi nor Jalaal will ever learn.",
    "80C9343B": "Well, yes, New Monarchy has always had an embarrassment of riches but we use them wisely and well, for the benefit of all.",
    "80C9343C": "I suppose there is one thing if you see my sister Emi out there, tell her I miss her. Tell her to come home.",
    "80C9343D": "Enjoying a quiet moment, I see. I didn't appreciate them before. Now these are the only times I can find peace.",
    "80C9343E": "I used to be loud and brash, back when I thought I could have everything. The Red War took much and taught me my limitations. A bitter gift.",
    "80C9343F": "We can wait.",
    "80C93440": "Our home is your home. We'll defend it together.",
    "80C93441": "You're our hope, Guardian.",
    "80C93443": "You will see how our interests align.",
    "80C93444": "Let's discuss.",
    "80C93445": "Let your fellow Guardians know you back New Monarchy.",
    "80C93446": "Please, join us in our celebrations.",
    "80C93447": "Won't you share our triumph with us?",
    "80C93448": "You see before you what victory looks like.",
    "80C93449": "Guardian! Join us! We celebrate today.",
    "80C9344B": "Success is contagious, Guardian. Won't you join us?",
    "80C9344D": "To your health! To New Monarchy's health! To the City!",
    "80C9344E": "Welcome! You've come at the right time!",
    "80C93450": "I couldn't be happier to see you.",
    "80C93451": "Look around at all this—joy and merriment! It's what the City needs.",
    "80C93452": "Hunter, you know what must be done to survive.",
    "80C93454": "A quick knife has served many monarchies, Hunter.",
    "80C93456": "Hunter care to have a word?",
    "80C93458": "May I have a moment of your time, Titan.",
    "80C9345A": "Titan, monarchies are built by people like yourself.",
    "80C9345C": "Your strength could be an asset to us, Titan.",
    "80C9345E": "Any ruler would require a Warlock's wisdom.",
    "80C93460": "Scholars thrive best in monarchies, Warlock.",
    "80C93462": "May I ask your counsel, Warlock?",
    "80C93464": "The Arachs may have won the Faction Rallies, but they have a long way to go before they convince the Consensus to abandon the City.",
    "80C93465": "Even when Dead Orbit wins, Arach Jalaal doesn't crack a smile. Why go looking for happiness on other planets? It's right here. He just can't see it.",
    "80C93466": "A surprising outcome. We will have to examine our methods, consider where we went wrong, and define a better strategy.",
    "80C93467": "Of all the losses we've experienced in recent years, this is the least painful. It will pass.",
    "80C93468": "Looked at a different way, this could be a gift. The sooner Jalaal has all his supplies and ships, the sooner he leaves.",
    "80C93469": "I won't miss the Arachs when they go. It'll be happier around here. Less gloomy.",
    "80C9346A": "All these drapes this looks like a funeral, not a party.",
    "80C9346B": "The reports are in. Shipments, transport logistics, supply chains Jalaal can enjoy his little triumph. We have real work to do.",
    "80C9346C": "A Dead Orbit celebration, eh? That's a contradiction in terms.",
    "80C9346D": "It's possible the instinct to run is just Jalaal's nature. First the Reef to Earth and now the earth to who knows where.",
    "80C9346E": "Ah, purple, purple, everywhere. The color of emperors. If only Lakshmi understood that her true calling lies in New Monarchy.",
    "80C9346F": "I didn't know that Exo facial structures could support expressions of smugness.",
    "80C93470": "I used to think Lakshmi was annoying. But only now do I truly understand how truly and deeply insufferable she can be. Ah, for my days of innocence",
    "80C93471": "Those who seek war will always find it. This victory is a tragedy for the city.",
    "80C93472": "I don't know what we're celebrating. More war? Pah.",
    "80C93473": "It's a fool's errand, chasing war. Always has been. Always will be.",
    "80C93474": "Lakshmi thinks she can calculate the future. But that's an illusion. We have no power over the future, only the present. And it's what we do now that matters.",
    "80C93475": "We have no control over the future. We can't promise victory in war. What does Lakshmi think she's up to?",
    "80C93476": "If Lakshmi gets her way, we'll be neck-deep in Vex before you can say 'But what about the Cabal?'",
    "80C93477": "When I ran an analysis on Lakshmi's contacts—well, let's just say she's tight with all our weapons foundries. Exclusive contracts. Generous kickbacks. Not surprising, if you champion violence.",
    "80C93478": "A bittersweet victory. Not one of the refugees we've helped has seen or heard of my sister Emi since the attack.",
    "80C93479": "I hear that rebuilding and resettlement have gone more quickly than expected, thanks to our donations and material sourcing.",
    "80C9347A": "(abstracted) All in her name. Always.",
    "80C9347B": "I want to hear those tables creaking under all the food we put on them. Turn no one away. Hunger will be an old, bad memory after this.",
    "80C9347C": "They should come to think of New Monarchy as the faction of plenty. We can afford to be generous, especially now.",
    "80C9347D": "Let's show them all that a win for New Monarchy is a win for the City.",
    "80C9347E": "Emi would have loved to see this. The decorations, the colors her brother, honored by the Consensus",
    "80C9347F": "I dreamed of this, long ago, when the New Monarchy was a ragtag bunch of believers with one guiding idea",
    "80C93480": "We cannot assign a monetary value to the new credibility this triumph has brought us. Additional speaking time in the Consensus, however—we can quantify that.",
    "80C93481": "Shaxx will not soon forget New Monarchy's importance.",
    "80C93482": "When we came back, it didn't feel like home. Half the people I knew were gone. Half the buildings too. I bent down and picked up a piece of rubble. Then another. And we began to rebuild.",
    "80C93483": "I lost a piece of myself in the Red War. We all did. The question is—will we find those missing pieces again?",
    "80C93484": "In some ways, it's easier to search for a unifying leader than to think about the past and future.",
    "80C93485": "But what are power and luxury worth, if they're not shared?",
    "80C93486": "New Monarchy's storehouses were spread widely throughout the City. The Red War destroyed most of them, but not all. That left us better placed to provide relief when we returned.",
    "80C93487": "Reports from the frontier are strange, to say the least.",
    "80C93488": "It's not that we want to rule. It's that there needs to be guidance—a figure to stand for all the people believe in.",
    "80C93489": "A strong leader will see us through.",
    "80C9348A": "(Ahem)",
    "80C9348B": "Political games feel small in the wake of the Red Legion's attack. ",
    "80C9348C": "Scour the refugee camps with every supply drop. Ask for her by name. Describe her. My sister is alive, I tell you. I will find her.",
    "80C9348D": "Supplies are critical to military success. If we destroy those processors, nectar sacs, fuel tanks, and Ether pods, we'll have our enemies at our mercy.",
    "80C9348E": "Our supporters will, of course, be far more effective and successful than Dead Orbit's or Future War Cult's. New Monarchy is all about results.",
    "80C9348F": "I've heard that the Traveler's Light has triggered old terraforming processes and mineral formation. Valuable relics might have surfaced. Best if New Monarchy finds them first.",
    "80C93490": "This is an opportunity for New Monarchy to publicly demonstrate our value to the City. We can't waste it. Or let Lakshmi take it from us.",
    "80C93491": "An excellent receiving volume! We'll do better, faster. No time to waste.",
    "80C93492": "New Monarchy can offer the Consensus both military and advisory support. The Consensus can offer us access to new markets. An outcome of mutual benefit.",
    "80C93493": "Sometimes I think I will never feel safe or have a good night's sleep again. And then I come up here, and look over this City we've rebuilt",
    "80C93494": "The Executors have always shown faith in Zavala's leadership. He's proven his worth time and again.",
    "80C93495": "Shaxx could use a reminder of New Monarchy's value.",
    "80C93496": "Here is a leader.",
    "80C93498": "We are honored to serve the City.",
    "80C93499": "You have news.",
    "80C9349A": "Something to say?",
    "80C9349B": "Guardian Will the Red Legion return?",
    "80C9349D": "Take your time.",
    "80C9349E": "Always good to see you, friend.",
    "80C934A0": "Guardian. How can I help you?",
    "80C934A2": "Our champion returns.",
    "80C934A4": "Back from the wilds, Guardian?",
    "80C934A6": "Your skills are always welcome, friend.",
    "80C934A8": "New Monarchy welcomes you back.",
    "80C934A9": "In unity, strength.",
    "80C934AA": "The City will benefit from our meeting.",
    "80C934AB": "Yes, Guardian?",
    "80C934AD": "New Monarchy appreciates your interest, Guardian.",
    "80C934AF": "You have my thanks.",
    "80C934B0": "You serve the New Monarchy well.",
    "80C934B1": "Make the City proud, Guardian.",
    "80C934B3": "I have no doubt you'll represent the best of New Monarchy.",
    "80C934B4": "There is no end to your talents.",
    "80C934B5": "New Monarchy thanks you.",
    "80C934B6": "I've known Jalaal for years. His heart is as dark as ship's oil, and even a little triumph won't lighten it. You'll see.",
    "80C934B7": "Jalaal refuses to face his fear and grief. He'd rather run away. It's a long story, and not a nice one.",
    "80C934B8": "Dead Orbit is anything but inspiring, and yet the Arach rallied many brave Guardians to his side and led them to victory. He must be doing something right. I wonder what.",
    "80C934B9": "Jalaal, a leader? No, I can't imagine it.",
    "80C934BA": "What's black and white but should be red all over?",
    "80C934BB": "I do admit, I'm curious about what Dead Orbit's starships will find. Think they'll send a postcard?",
    "80C934BC": "I'm afraid that, without good leadership, Dead Orbit will disintegrate in the end.",
    "80C934BD": "I wouldn't ever want to abandon this beautiful planet to the Fallen. It's our home. Our responsibility.",
    "80C934BE": "Jalaal and I grew up three streets apart. But I don’t like to dwell on those days. And as the years pass, it becomes harder and harder to talk to him at all.",
    "80C934BF": "Mark my words. If—When—things settle, Dead Orbit will go right back to their plans for abandoning this world.",
    "80C934C0": "I am sorry to have let us all down. It was a failure of leadership, and I will learn from it.",
    "80C934C1": "I'll bet you the best gun in our arsenal that Future War Cult will lead us to destruction.",
    "80C934C2": "This is a chance to demonstrate the superiority of our methods. Soft power instead of firepower. Generosity instead of forecasting.",
    "80C934C3": "I might have been wrong about winning, but I was not wrong about the hearts of our Guardians.",
    "80C934C4": "With the right leader, any failure can become success.",
    "80C934C5": "This is why we search for a unifying leader. This is why I can't take that mantle upon myself.",
    "80C934C6": "I won't waste time dwelling on mistakes. What matters is the way forward, and the future. Wouldn't Lakshmi laugh to hear that!",
    "80C934C7": "Future War Cult's plans will only create more misery. And New Monarchy can only do so much to relieve it.",
    "80C934C8": "Lakshmi would be a natural leader, if she understood the costs of her actions. But she doesn't.",
    "80C934C9": "This defeat is an opportunity to learn and grow. How many other factions would see it that way?",
    "80C934CA": "Merit wins out, in the end.",
    "80C934CB": "Our efforts on behalf of the City's dispossessed have finally been recognized. This honor was a long time coming.",
    "80C934CC": "A victory for New Monarchy is a victory for the City. We will make our advanced technology available to all Guardians, for a time.",
    "80C934CD": "For a week, we will open our vaults to all Guardians as a gesture of goodwill.",
    "80C934CE": "This City looks glorious in red and white. Triumphant. Like a parade.",
    "80C934CF": "This is all thanks to hard work, late nights, and careful organization. Also the support of our loyal Guardians.",
    "80C934D0": "We all knew how committed New Monarchy's Guardians are to service. So we weren't surprised by the outcome.",
    "80C934D1": "Our celebration is open to all! How else can others see the benefits of joining us?",
    "80C934D2": "This is just a taste of the joy and glory that New Monarchy can bring.",
    "80C934D3": "I've never seen the City look more beautiful.",
    "80C934D4": "Yes, obviously we must all join hands to rebuild, Lakshmi and Jalaal included. But I never said I'd like it.",
    "80C934D5": "I built this section of the Tower will my own funds—and my own hands. This is my home, and I will neither abandon it nor endanger it.",
    "80C934D6": "I am in favor of these Faction Rallies. They might not bring us together, but the City and its people will benefit.",
    "80C934D7": "I am sure that with a little demonstration of our capabilities, the Consensus will be inclined to hear our business propositions.",
    "80C934D8": "I have no doubts whatsoever that New Monarchy will win these Faction Rallies.",
    "80C934D9": "New Monarchy seeks Guardians who demonstrate generosity and seize the present moment.",
    "80C934DA": "Dead Orbit are fearmongers. And War Cult? They're too secretive to be trusted with any real power.",
    "80C934DB": "New Monarchy has many interests... and we pay well.",
    "80C934DC": "It's always good to see a Guardian flying the New Monarchy banner.",
    "80C934DE": "Together we will keep this city safe.",
    "80C934DF": "Ask any civilian. They’ll tell you how New Monarchy responded in their time of need. ",
    "80C934E0": "The difference is, New Monarchy cares. We do our part. We give.",
    "80C934E1": "Our strongest currency is the people’s gratitude, Guardian.",
    "80C934E3": "Long ago, when I was without food, money, or purpose, an Executor saw potential in me and took me in. I assumed his mantle when he passed.",
    "80C934E4": "All that I have—quite a lot, really—I owe to New Monarchy.",
    "80C934E5": "Good leadership gives a sense of safety. And we all need to feel safe again.",
    "80C934E6": "What this City needs is structure. New Monarchy can provide it.",
    "80C934E7": "The one thing I missed most, while were shivering in our camps, was a warm, clean pair of socks. Funny how much the small things matter.",
    "80C934E8": "I feared losing everything and having to start over. So I refused to think about it. And to my surprise, after it happened, well, look around you.",
    "80C934E9": "Even after so much loss, we remain strong. Because we stand together. Human. Exo. Awoken. Guardian and civilian. We are one.",
    "80C934EA": "All yours, friend.",
    "80C934EC": "This should suit your needs.",
    "80C934ED": "Few have an eye as keen as yours.",
    "80C934EE": "Great choice, Guardian. It will serve you well.",
    "80C934F0": "It's yours, Guardian.",
    "80C934F2": "Striking.",
    "80C934F3": "Fit for royalty.",
    "80C934F5": "Fly these colors proudly.",
    "80C934F6": "A token of New Monarchy's regard.",
    "80C934F7": "Red and white suits you, Guardian.",
    "80C934F9": "Our armory offers only the best in firearms and combat gear.",
    "80C934FA": "Only the best for allies of the New Monarchy.",
    "80C934FB": "A gem. Worthy of your legend.",
    "80C934FC": "You have a taste for the finer things, I see.",
    "80C934FD": "You have chosen wisely, and will not be disappointed.",
    "80C934FF": "Ahhh One of New Monarchy's best.",
    "80C93500": "Until next time.",
    "80C93501": "Return safely, Guardian.",
    "80C93503": "Keep protecting this world, Guardian.",
    "80C93505": "Keep fighting for our home, Guardian.",
    "80C93507": "Come back any time.",
    "80C93508": "Go with speed and wit, Hunter.",
    "80C9350A": "Until your travels lead you home, Hunter.",
    "80C9350C": "Show the world your strength, Titan.",
    "80C9350E": "You are the wall beyond the walls, Titan.",
    "80C93510": "Until your wisdom brings you home, Warlock.",
    "80C93512": "May your wisdom guide you, scholar.",
    "80C93514": "Tell me—did you find any new secrets on Mercury?",
    "80C93515": "I can feel the heat coming off your armor. Been to Mercury recently?",
    "80C93517": "Have you taken a run through the SRL? ",
    "80C93519": "Reviewing the SRL results is a guilty pleasure.",
    "80C9351A": "Do you consider yourself a Sparrow jockey, Guardian?",
    "80C9351C": "May your Light warm even the harshest cold.",
    "80C9351D": "This is a season of change. Embrace it.",
    "80C9351E": "New Monarchy does not fear longer nights.",
    "80C9351F": "The Festival of the Lost is upon us, Guardian.",
    "80C93521": "Happy Festival of the Lost!",
    "80C93522": "I understand the escape in make-believe, but don't get too lost in the Festival's revelry.",
    "80C93523": "The Crimson Days are upon us.",
    "80C93524": "Like New Monarchy, the Crimson Days celebrate unity.",
    "80C93525": "Joyous Crimson Days to you, Guardian.",
    "80C93527": "Do you feel renewed, Guardian?",
    "80C93529": "Life blooms anew. Can you feel it?",
    "80C9352A": "Surviving to see another season of renewal is no small feat.",
    "80C9352B": "Enjoy the sun, Guardian.",
    "80C9352D": "May the Sol's light energize you.",
    "80C9352E": "Sol's light is life. Even more so than the Traveler's gifts.",
    "80C9352F": "Another Dawning has come and still the City stands.",
    "80C93530": "Happy Dawning, Guardian.",
    "80C93532": "May the Dawning bring you new hope. ",
    "80C93533": "What treasure have you found stashed In that prison?",
    "80C93534": "So you've been fighting in the Reef's Prison again?",
    "80C93536": "Do you truly understand the dangers you face in that Prison, Guardian?",
    "80C93538": "Word is you've been to the Lighthouse. Impressive.",
    "80C9353A": "You've seen the Lighthouse on Mercury? Any signs of Osiris?",
    "80C9353C": "Setting foot in the Lighthouse is a rare feat. I'm intrigued.",
    "80C9353D": "What can you tell me of the Reef?",
    "80C9353E": "Back from the Reef, I see.",
    "80C9353F": "Your relationship with the Reef is an asset to this City.",
    "80BBF94D": "I need your help with this.",
    "80BBF951": "We have a problem, and you can help.",
    "80BBF953": "We're tracking something here. I think you can help.",
    "80BBF955": "I have something here, just for you!",
    "80BBF957": "I'm worried about this one. Help me out?",
    "80BBF959": "You would be perfect for this job!",
    "80BBF95B": "Got a mission here with your name on it.",
    "80BBF95D": "I need this thing done, Guardian. What do you say?",
    "80BBF95F": "Don't let the view distract you. ",
    "80BBF961": "Were you gonna say something?",
    "80BBF963": "Can can I help you? Or?",
    "80BBF965": "Hey, sorry. I'm pretty busy. What's going on?",
    "80BBF967": "Guardian. Oh! Guardian!",
    "80BD0F9E": "When we first got here, I started the clans as a way to make people feel ... safer. A way to let them know we were all in this together. And, of course, to prove I was right. Haha.",
    "80BD0FA0": "My favorite clans are the ones that stand for something. That stand together in combat and in comradery Those are the clans that last.",
    "80BD0FA2": "You ever think your clanmates are a little weird? Don't worry, Guardian. Everybody's weird.",
    "80BD0FA4": "Hey, Guardian. You in there?",
    "80BD0FA6": "Where'd you go?",
    "80BD0FA8": "I lost you, didn't I? Come on back.",
    "80BD0FAA": "Hoo. Looks like the Dead Zone has claimed another one.",
    "80BD0FAC": "You'd make a fantastic perch for a bird at this rate.",
    "80BD0FAE": "Are you trying to figure out how to talk to me? I have that problem with people too. Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite you.",
    "80BD0FB0": "I survived on my own for a long time, you know? Having smart, experienced people around me makes all the difference.",
    "80BD0FB2": "Back when I first left the City, if you told me I'd be here, in this place, doing this job, I'd have said you were nuts. But I think I'm pretty good at it. And sometimes you just have to answer the call. You know?",
    "80BD0FB4": "I've seen more people in the last day than I've seen in years. It's a little overwhelming. But I'm armed, so I like my chances.",
    "80BD0FB6": "I know this little outpost isn't gonna hold forever. But for however long it lasts, this is home. And that ain't nothin'.",
    "80BD0FC0": "We're not going to last out here forever. I know that. But the Farm isn't about a new home in the wilds. It's about hope. And we need that right now.",
    "80BD0FC2": "I've known Devrim my whole life. He's like an uncle! You know, just one that actually cares about me. ",
    "80BD0FC4": "Zavala's an interesting guy. I think I was a teenager, and I heard him giving a speech about— I wanna say the walls. That sounds right.",
    "80BD0FC6": "Ikora Rey. A little intimidating, but if anyone is going to solve that whole 'death' thing, I bet it's her.",
    "80BD0FC8": "Don't get me started on Cayde. That guy, always swinging through the City thinking he's a big shot. Guess what? He's not nearly as funny as he thinks he is.",
    "80BBF98D": "Let's you and me talk.",
    "80BBF98F": "Chit-chat. You and me.",
    "80BBF991": "Let's do the thing.",
    "80BBF993": "Hey there, Guardian. What's up?",
    "80BBF995": "Hey hey hey.",
    "80BBF997": "Just ignore the bird. Talk to me.",
    "80BBF999": "And what would you like to say?",
    "80BBF99B": "Did you need something?",
    "80BBF99D": "We're all the same, deep down, we all want the same things. Guardian, Ghost, Human, Exo, Awoken  Frame. Bird? ",
    "80BBF99F": "Deep breaths, Suraya, deep breaths. These are good people and none of them are bears.",
    "80BBF9A1": "Keep it together, girl.",
    "80BBF9A3": "If I'd known I was going to be running herd on this many Guardians, I would probably have listened at school more.",
    "80BBF9A5": "We should have some kind of 'clan mixer.' With cookies and— no, no, no there's a war on. Right.",
    "80BBF9A7": "'Yeah! Great idea, Suraya. It's been years since you spent time with people. I guess you're in charge now!' How did I let you talk me into this?",
    "80BBF9A9": "Look at that view! Just imagine if we weren't constantly in fear for our lives. This would be the best trip ever!",
    "80BBF9AB": "He was a funny one, wasn't he? Reminded me of that time with you and that raven.",
    "80BBF9AD": "Was he looking at you funny? I think he was looking at you funny because you're a bird.",
    "80BBF9AF": "I know you want to go flying, but I need you here. Besides, where would I be if the Cabal use you for target practice?",
    "80BBF9B1": "Do you want rabbit or dove tonight? Whatever you want, birdbrain.",
    "80BBF9B3": "Devrim, buddy. We've talked about this. No, your family name is not at stake!",
    "80BBF9B5": "Tyra, you're doing a great job. If anyone is giving you grief, you point them at me. ",
    "80BBF9B7": "Devrim, keep your head down. No, I don't think the Fallen are interested in debating you.",
    "80BBF9B9": "A clan is just a family you choose to join. ",
    "80BBF9BB": "Talk to me.",
    "80BBF9BD": "I'm here.",
    "80BBF9BF": "Say what you wanna say.",
    "80BBF9C1": "Did you wanna talk to me?",
    "80BBF9C3": "Did you have some clan stuff to talk about?",
    "80BBF9C5": "Are you still with us?",
    "80BBF9C7": "Heya!",
    "80BBF9C9": "Yup yup.",
    "80BBF9CB": "Mmm hmm?",
    "80BBF9CD": "Hi!",
    "80BBF9CF": "Hey there.",
    "80BBF9D1": "Yyyes?",
    "80BBF9D3": "Whaddya need?",
    "80BBF9D5": "What can I do for you?",
    "80BBF9D7": "And what can I do for you?",
    "80BBF9D9": "Guardian! Hello!",
    "80BD0FCA": "Hey! How's the clan going?",
    "80BD0FD4": "Been hearing a lot of chatter about your clan!",
    "80BD0FDC": "Clan going okay? Everybody happy?",
    "80BD0FDE": "Hey hey! How's the clan going?",
    "80BD0FE0": "You going to hang out with your clan today?",
    "80BD0FE2": "Tell your clanmates I said hi!",
    "80BD0FE4": "I hear it on the streets, Guardian. Your clan is making a difference.",
    "80BD0FE6": "Your clan has done some real good out there!",
    "80BD0FE8": "You're making a change out there. You and your clan.",
    "80BD0FEA": "Your clan has what it takes. Keep it up!",
    "80BD0FEC": "Got a banner for you here. Wear it with pride.",
    "80BD0FEE": "Symbols inspire people. That's why clans fly their banners!",
    "80BD0FF0": "Grab a banner and get inspired, Guardian!",
    "80BBF9F9": "Supplies, security, communications, transportation, scouting hoo! And that's just this morning. Great!",
    "80BBF9FB": "What did they ever do for us, down in the City? Clans are for the people.",
    "80BBF9FD": "We need people we can trust. That's what a clan is for.",
    "80BBF9FF": "This is all worth it. You can do this.",
    "80BBFA01": "Ugh. So much people.",
    "80BBFA03": "(laughs) Ohhh, need to tell Devrim about that one.",
    "80BBFA05": "Did the bird distract you? He does that.",
    "80BD0FF2": "Wear it into battle. Let em' see you coming!",
    "80BD0FF4": "The only symbol you need is your clan banner.",
    "80BD1037": "May it bring you glory, and honor, and all that other stuff too!",
    "80BD1039": "The banner is yours! Now get out there and change the world!",
    "80BD103B": "Hope it's something good!",
    "80BD1044": "Oh man I hope it's great!",
    "80BD1046": "Lemme know what you get!",
    "80BD1048": "Think of your clan when you use it!",
    "80BD104A": "Remember, your clan earned this!",
    "80BD104C": "I think that's a good one.",
    "80BD104E": "Wish I'd had that years ago.",
    "80BD1050": "Ooh, ooh! Nice choice!",
    "80BD1052": "Good call with that one.",
    "80BD1054": "Couldn't have picked better myself.",
    "80BD1056": "That's gonna work great for you, I can tell.",
    "80BD1058": "Get out there and put it to the test.",
    "80BD1060": "Why not? I think yeah, good pick.",
    "80BD1062": "Gonna try it on for— uh, no. Just buying it. OK.",
    "80BD1064": "Tough enough even for the EDZ!",
    "80BD10A0": "Oh, man. I've had my eye on that.",
    "80BD10A2": "I'I'll be honest. I didn't even know we had that.",
    "80BD10B5": "That's a rare find! Let me know how it works.",
    "80BD10B8": "Big spender, huh? Nice.",
    "80BD10BA": "Yes! Oh, that's a great pick. You'll love it.",
    "80BBFA37": "Be careful out there.",
    "80BBFA39": "Take care of yourself, OK?",
    "80BBFA3B": "Catch you later!",
    "80BBFA3D": "Bye!",
    "80BBFA3F": "See you soon!",
    "80BBFA42": "Did the hawk get you?",
    "80BBFA46": "Tower to Guardian. Come in, Guardian.",
    "80BBFA48": "If I had my Light right now, hoo -boy  those  man, those Cabal sure would be scared.",
    "80BBFA4A": "Hey, keep your eyes open when you're out there. Old Hunter lore: there's always treasure where you least expect it. Often? It's in someone's pockets.",
    "80BBFA4C": "Look at the trees out there, Guardian. Back in the day, this was my home. The forests of Earth, the deserts of Mars, the pits of the Moon. Guess it's true  you can never go home again.",
    "80BBFA4E": "What's up, Guardian?",
    "80BBFA50": "Guardian, what's up in the EDZ?",
    "80BBFA52": "Yup?",
    "80BBFA54": "Yo.",
    "80BBFA56": "Hey.",
    "80BBFA58": "Hmm. She's done real good with this place. ",
    "80BBFA5A": "Would you look at all those trees? Guy could get used to that.",
    "80BBFA5C": "One of my best ideas in years, and the Vex screw it up. Figures.",
    "80BBFA5E": "If I just slipped out of camp  I mean, who'd notice?",
    "80BBFA60": "I'm still here, Zavala! You don't to check on me every ten mintues!",
    "80BBFA62": "Need anything?",
    "80BBFA64": "Go on.",
    "80BBFA66": "You still with me?",
    "80BBFA68": "Back from the wilds!",
    "80BBFA6A": "Tell me a tale.",
    "80BBFA6C": "Hey hey!",
    "80BBFA6E": "Guardian?",
    "80BBFA70": "Have something for me?",
    "80BBFA72": "What's the story?",
    "80BBFA74": "If you get a chance, tell Hawthorne she owes me a rematch. Last two don't count.",
    "80BBFA76": "Bring it on, Guardian.",
    "80BBFA78": "All right, see you around.",
    "80BBFA7A": "Stay safe out there.",
    "80BBFA7C": "Bring back some tales, Guardian.",
    "80BBFA7E": "Hey psst. Good luck out there.",
    "80BBFA80": "Keep your head down.",
    "80BBFA83": "You appreciate silence, I see. Good.",
    "80BBFA87": "We choose our words carefully. As it should be.",
    "80BBFA89": "Since my earliest memories as a Guardian, I have relied on my power, my skill with the Light. Without that, what am I? It has been a long journey, but I have my poetry. My tactical knowledge even my knitting.",
    "80BBFA8B": "Operations across the solar system must continue if we are ever to reclaim what was once ours.",
    "80BBFA8D": "A year ago, if you had told me I would be standing here I would never have believed you. Now, we've been given shelter by a woman with the will of ten Guardians. I stand beneath the trees, look up at the Traveler's legacy and dream of a better future.",
    "80BBFA8F": "One day, Guardian. One day we will retake the deserts of Mars. We will reclaim the lost cities of Venus, and stride again on the surface of Luna. Mark my words. We shall return.",
    "80BBFA91": "Guardian. Report.",
    "80BBFA93": "Come forward.",
    "80BBFA95": "What do you need?",
    "80BBFA99": "This outpost is a testament to the human spirit. I must remember this place.",
    "80BBFA9B": "A Titan beyond the walls. Who would have thought?",
    "80BBFA9D": "Sloane was the right choice. We did all that we could.",
    "80BBFA9F": "What does the future hold?",
    "80BBFAA1": "Cayde? Are you still there? Don't make me come looking for you.",
    "80BBFAA3": "Something on your mind?",
    "80BBFAA5": "Tell me you have something.",
    "80BBFAA7": "Let's get to work.",
    "80BBFAA9": "Are you ready?",
    "80BBFAAB": "Hello, Guardian.",
    "80BBFAAD": "Greetings.",
    "80BBFAAF": "Did you need something?",
    "80BBFAB1": "We have much to discuss.",
    "80BBFAB3": "Indeed.",
    "80BBFAB5": "Anything to report, Guardian?",
    "80BBFAB7": "I assume you need something?",
    "80BBFAB9": "Remember what we fight for.",
    "80BBFABB": "Farewell.",
    "80BBFABD": "Be brave.",
    "80BBFABF": "As you were.",
    "80BBFAC4": "I'm not THAT intimidating.",
    "80BBFAC8": "Did you forget why you came here? ",
    "80BBFACA": "Use your words.",
    "80BBFACC": "The absence of my Light gnawed at me because I chose it to be so. Here, I can focus. I can meditate. I can see the space within not as void, but as potential.",
    "80BBFACE": "I am developing a new Warlock technique. One that does not require the Light. This time of self-reflection may lead to something truly special in time.",
    "80BBFAD0": "Could you ask Hawthorne if I might ahem. If might have more time with the bird, at some point?",
    "80BBFAD2": "We do not belong here, Guardian. This place is beautiful. But our lives are not meant for beauty. Our Ghosts made a choice. And that choice binds us to a path that often goes to dark, dark places.",
    "80BBFAD4": "A little closer, Guardian.",
    "80BBFAD6": "What is it?",
    "80BBFAD8": "What is it?",
    "80BBFADA": "I must have lost track of time. Hello, Guardian.",
    "80BBFADC": "The Light surrounds us here. But not the Light of the City. Had I forgotten?",
    "80BBFADE": "I can see him. There, atop the spire. Beneath the Light.",
    "80BBFAE0": "The Taken can keep that moon. There are other places",
    "80BBFAE2": "This place is not for you, Ikora Rey. Do not think otherwise.",
    "80BBFAE4": "Cayde! Zavala. Stop yelling at each other!",
    "80BBFAE6": "Excuse me. My mind was somewhere else.",
    "80BBFAE8": "I am here. Enough of me, anyway.",
    "80BBFAEA": "Do you have knowledge to share?",
    "80BBFAEC": "Anything you need?",
    "80BBFAEE": "What do you seek?",
    "80BBFAF0": "Yes, Guardian?",
    "80BBFAF2": "What can you teach me?",
    "80BBFAF4": "Take time to understand the world around you. ",
    "80BBFAF6": "My mind is in a thousand places. I can speak to you as well.",
    "80BBFAF8": "Nothing, then? Are you sure? I think otherwise.",
    "80BBFAFA": "Good luck.",
    "80BBFAFC": "Carry the Light with you.",
    "80BBFAFE": "We stand behind you.",
    "80BBFB00": "Come back safe.",
    "80BBFB02": "Be well.",
    "80BBFB05": "Guardian, care to lend a hand?",
    "80BBFB09": "Like adventure? Of course you do.",
    "80BBFB0B": "Eververse needs a favor.",
    "80BBFB0D": "Take a little trip for your friends at Eververse?",
    "80BBFB0F": "I'm sure you don't mind helping out a local entrepreneur.",
    "80BBFB11": "Eververse may have use for someone with your talents.",
    "80BBFB13": "Errands to run, goods to sell, adventures to be adventured. Interested?",
    "80BBFB15": "I've got a thing that needs to be done. Nothing major, but maybe worth your while.",
    "80BBFB17": "Supply chain is rerouted and humming. Inventory is stocked, and business is back to normal. Eververse: always open.",
    "80BBFB1B": "Heard a Guardian bragging about trashing a Gatelord. Fenchurch once beat three of them in a barefoot race across the First Sun. He showed me the blisters.",
    "80BBFB1D": "There are still surprises in the world. Finding settlements outside the City? That surprised me. ",
    "80BBFB1F": "A lot of good people died in the Red Legion attack. Those of us who are left we find a new way to go on. ",
    "80BBFB21": "If you ask me, the Red Legion are compensating for something. No one would wear armor like that if they didn't have issues. ",
    "80BBFB23": "I love the smell of commerce in the morning! Or you know whenever.",
    "80BBFB25": "Have I told you about the time Fenchurch defended his title at the Hypno-Rhythmic Festival of Controlled Movement?",
    "80BBFB27": "I've heard things from friends who are still in the Reef. Disturbing things. ",
    "80BBFB29": "Fenchurch says all Awoken are of a kind. But I never felt at home in the Reef. Maybe I'm not their kind. ",
    "80BBFB2B": "Want to take a look, Guardian? Eververse has a lot to offer.",
    "80BBFB2D": "Welcome to the all-new Eververse, Guardian.",
    "80BBFB31": "Even war needs style. We've got that.",
    "80BBFB33": "New location. New inventory. Still the same Eververse. ",
    "80BBFB35": "We took a hit, but we're still standing. ",
    "80BBFB37": "Need something new? Eververse has it. ",
    "80BBFB39": "Always something new at Eververse. ",

    "80BBFB41": "'Eververse' isn’t just a title — it's a family philosophy. 'Always another mile, and forever another tomorrow.'",
    "80BBFB43": "…so then I opened the crate. Needless to say, I sent the whole shipment back to Fenchurch.",
    "80BBFB47": "It's nice to have Fenchurch back. Or, at least as 'back' as an absentee adventurer can be, when he's never here.",
    "80BBFB49": "Ugh. We lost everything but our sense of style. ",
    "80BBFB4B": "Not everything about the Farm is terrible. I've learned how to turn shabby into chic. ",
    "80BBFB4D": "A little polish, a little redecorating, and this might be home. ",
    "80BBFB4F": "Ah! New settlements, new expansion opportunities for Eververse. ",
    "80BBFB51": "'Eververse' isn't just a title — it's a promise.",

    "80BBFB8F": "Fenchurch is already looking for new inventory. The Cabal can't stop style.",
    "80BBFB91": "I never dreamt the Tower would fall, but gotta say, I'm really liking this new set-up.",
    "80BBFB93": "There's a fresh wind in the air and fresh new goods in stock. Welcome to Eververse.",
    "80BBFB95": "It's easy math, Guardian You got the Silver, Eververse has the goods. ",
    "80BBFB97": "Take as long as you like. I can wait. ",
    "80BBFB99": "Our inventory is stocked, so no rush.",
    "80BBFB9B": "Don't know where my uncle finds these things.",
    "80BBFB9D": "Not everything Fenchurch sends is safe to sell.",
    "80BBFB9F": "Fenchurch says a lot of fantastic things. I tend to believe him.",
    "80BBFBA1": "Excellent choice. ",
    "80BBFBA3": "Always a pleasure.",
    "80BBFBA5": "Eververse thanks you. ",
    "80BBFBA7": "Another satisfied customer. ",
    "80BBFBA9": "Yeah That'll work.",
    "80BBFBAB": "I like your style.",
    "80BBFBAD": "Guardian, I like your style.",
    "80BBFBAF": "That is one of my best items. ",
    "80BBFBB1": "I may be a little jealous right now.",
    "80BBFBB3": "You don't see those every day. ",
    "80BBFBB5": "These aren't easy to come by.",
    "80BBFBB7": "Items like these don't come on the market very often. ",
    "80BBFBB9": "Fenchurch found that one for me. Use it well. ",
    "80BBFBBB": "I get new inventory all the time, so check back soon.",
    "80BBFBBD": "Thank you for shopping at Eververse. ",
    "80BBFBBF": "Thanks for shopping Eververse, Guardian.",
    "80BBFBC1": "Come see me again, Guardian. ",
    "80BD10BC": "You're becoming a favorite in the Crucible. Don't let it go to your head.",
    "80BD10BE": "You're always pleasantly vicious, Guardian. It's a delight.",
    "80BD10C0": "Watching you makes me wish I could compete in the Crucible again myself.",
    "80BD10C2": "The Crucible was made for Guardians like you and me.",
    "80BD10C4": "Brave, Guardian. Very brave.",
    "80BD10C6": "I have a mission for you, Guardian.",
    "80BD10C8": "You're needed in the field. This one's big.",
    "80BD10CA": "You want this. I can tell. Fight hard.",
    "80BD10CC": "I need you—not to fight Guardians, but for a special operation.",
    "80BD10CE": "Crucible needs a representative beyond the City walls, and you're the best.",
    "80BD10D0": "I need you to do some damage for me, Guardian.",
    "80BD10D2": "You love the Crucible, don't you, Guardian? Think carefully.",
    "80BD10DC": "Every exercise with Light should teach you something.",
    "80BD10DE": "Think of it as training, Guardian. You can only get stronger from this.",
    "80BD10E0": "You're never afraid to go out there. Good.",
    "80BD10E2": "You have a thirst for the fight. Excellent.",
    "80BD1109": "I need more like you in the Crucible, Guardian.",
    "80BD110B": "A passion for hard work. I like that.",
    "80BD110D": "I see your Light improves by the day.",
    "80BD110F": "Yes! Now do it again.",
    "80BBFBDC": "Can you believe these neophytes? You never talked to me like that.",
    "80BBFBDE": "The Tower is never dull when you're around.",
    "80BBFBE0": "Tell me. How do the front lines fare? What I wouldn't give to fight again.",
    "80BBFBE2": "Back from the EDZ? The Shard sounds like a Speaker's tale.",
    "80BBFBE4": "Give me a minute. I need to handle this.  What do you think 'Heavy ammo available' means, Guardian? Tell me! Because I don't think you get it.",
    "80BBFBE6": "You can’t fight when you're that tense, Guardian. What’s wrong with you? Relax. Relax more. I said, 'Relax!'",
    "80BBFBE8": "Redjacks have Crucible arenas set up all across the system. It’s a beautiful network of shining beacons atop a sea of dark. Now the Red Legion wants to roll in and take it all down? We bore the colors first—and we wear it better.",
    "80BBFBEC": "I need you in there, Guardian. Show the recruits what real Light can do.",
    "80BBFBEE": "Why can't they all be like you, Guardian? If we had this crop of rookies at Twilight Gap, we'd all be speaking Fallen.",
    "80FF503A": "There is so much the Crucible can learn from you, Guardian. Go. Fight. Teach us.",
    "80FF503C": "You're doing good work in the Crucible. The recruits need to see it.",
    "80FF503E": "The Tower watches your matches with interest these days, Guardian. Don't disappoint them.",
    "80FF5040": "Tell Hawthorne I said, 'Soon.' She'll understand.",
    "80FF5042": "Every visitor to this system leaves big ships for me to take. Red Legion is no exception. Heh.",
    "80C93848": "She was always an excellent sparring partner. They say the Awoken are a strong people, but even my Ghost can't get rid of those bruises.",
    "80C93849": "So. Queen Mara has returned. I should pay her a visit",
    "80C9384A": "They say the Dreaming City has been cursed. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Guardian? You do walk with the world-ending sort.",
    "80C9384B": "I can glimpse the dark in your Light, Guardian. You've made a bargain. You wouldn't be the first. Watch your back out there. And always strike first.",
    "80C9384C": "So it's done. Your march of vengeance across the Tangled Shore. Uldren dead. Cayde avenged. I have one question: Are you ready for the Crucible?",
    "80C9384D": "Whether you killed Uldren or not—you crushed the Barons, and you avenged Cayde. He would never say the words, but he'd be proud of you.",
    "80C9384E": "Are you back to Tower duties full-time, then? Tell me. Did you finish Uldren?",
    "80C9384F": "The Red War is won, and now the lawless frontier of the Tangled Shore beckons. I envy you, Guardian.",
    "80C93850": "The Fallen have become a problem again. So I've taken it upon myself to develop new training regimens around their technology. Give Breakthrough a spin, Guardian.",
    "80C93851": "The Reef is in trouble. It seems the universe deems that its people haven't yet suffered enough",
    "80C93852": "What Cayde called 'combat' made me laugh. But he was good at cheating.",
    "80C93853": "Get out there and do what you do best. Uldren and his Barons won't kill themselves.",
    "80C93854": "Cayde's gone. Despite what Zavala may say you must fight in his stead.",
    "80C93855": "What I mean to say is that her brother was a goon, but she was once my Crimson Bond. On that day, she asked me to read to her. I told her, 'No one tells me what to do.' And I recited 'The Tempest' from memory. All five acts. She didn't blink. I think she was trying to put me off.",
    "80C93856": "Cayde's gone, and I wasn't the one to kill him. Always thought it would be me.",
    "80FF504C": "Looks like the Vanguard has you pretty busy these days. Whenever you have some time, my Crucible rookies could always use a reminder of what true power looks like.",
    "80FF504E": "The Red Legion has taken from us. It's time you took from them. How can I help?",
    "80FF5050": "Your Vanguard work is exemplary, Guardian. The Crucible could use more participation from veterans like you.",
    "80FF5052": "Back from a Vanguard operation? It was special operations that unearthed the Vault of Glass, ended Crota, and finished Oryx. But do you think Guardians could have accomplished those things without Crucible training? Be careful how you answer.",
    "80FF5054": "Your work in Vanguard operations is doing them proud. Even Zavala is smiling. You've never seen him smile? It's only in his eyes. Anyway, don't forget the Crucible. It hasn't forgotten you.",
    "80FF5056": "You sweat and toil for the Vanguard. There is nobility in that. Will you do the same for my Crucible?",
    "80FF5058": "These recruits are killing me. Have you ever seen a knife thrown so poorly?",
    "80FF505A": "You would never insult me with knifework like this, Hunter. These rookies haven't been practicing. And it shows.",
    "80FF505C": "If you're not there, the bullets can't get you. The rookies don't understand, Hunter.",
    "80FF505E": "You're here, Titan. Time to show the Crucible how it's done.",
    "80FF5060": "The recruits have so much to learn, Titan. I'm glad you don't give me grief like that.",
    "80FF5062": "When I look at you, Titan, and I remember that every punch you throw comes with intention and purpose, a little part of me dies to see the rookies care so little.",
    "80FF5064": "I'm counting on you, Warlock. Far as I can tell the new recruits can't even read.",
    "80FF5066": "He calls that a Nova Bomb. Do me a favor. Get in there, and show them how it's done, Warlock.",
    "80FF5068": "Your intuition is a sword, Warlock. Take it into the Crucible, and cut them to pieces.",
    "80BBFC1A": "Welcome back. Here to forge your Light?",
    "80BBFC1C": "Ah, it's the other hero of the Tower attack. Haha!",
    "80BBFC1E": "What do you need, Guardian? I've got a moment.",
    "80BBFC20": "Welcome, Guardian. We're just settling in.",
    "80BD1115": "Battle looks well on you.",
    "80BD1117": "How many Cabal did you get, today?",
    "80BD1135": "What's the word from the frontlines? The Crucible is chanting your name.",
    "80BD1137": "Some of these rookies, Guardian—they're rude.",
    "80C93857": "The Reef is in turmoil. Nothing changes.",
    "80C93858": "More than ever, the Reef needs our help.",
    "80C93859": "I can see it in your Light. You've made a bargain",
    "80C9385A": "Tell me, Guardian: Did you pull the trigger on the fair Prince?",
    "80C9385B": "You've pursued your vendetta. What about the Crucible?",
    "80C9385C": "Cayde is gone. And so, now, is Uldren.",
    "80C9385D": "Have you found retribution? The Crucible is waiting.",
    "80C9385E": "In war or peace, the life of a Guardian is a life of loss.",
    "80C9385F": "Cayde's gone. And he won't be the last.",
    "80C93860": "The Scorn have no social grace.",
    "80C93861": "The Tangled Shore? It's a lawless frontier.",
    "80C93862": "Fallen? Scorn? In battle, they're just another target.",
    "80FF506E": "Hunter, these new recruits remind me of you. Swift. Full of raw potential.",
    "80FF5070": "Get in there and show me your speed, Hunter.",
    "80FF5072": "Titan, you have to lead by example.",
    "80FF5074": "Enter the Crucible, Titan. Show me your strength.",
    "80FF5076": "How's your Light, Warlock? Keeping it fierce?",
    "80FF5078": "Warlock. Get in there and show the recruits what real Light is.",
    "80BBFC38": "I want double Crucible shifts. I won't have the rookies out there without knowing the basics.",
    "80BBFC3A": "With every new threat, there's a new cadre of Guardians to forge.",
    "80BBFC3C": "You think the Red Legion would stop there? You must defeat your opponent completely.",
    "80BBFC40": "Tell the Vanguard if they want better fighters on the frontlines, they need to give me time.",
    "80BBFC42": "I don't care that you have Strikes to get to. Worry about the fight in front of you.",
    "80BBFC44": "You tell the Vanguard the fighting's not done. That means Guardian training continues.",
    "80BBFC46": "Dying is an essential element of the Crucible. Get back in there.",
    "80BBFC48": "There's still fighting left to do, Guardians. Get to work.",
    "80BBFC4A": "If there's any fight left in you, Guardian, get up and give it to me.",
    "80BBFC4C": "Did you see that grenade toss? He's a danger only to himself.",
    "80BBFC4E": "The Crucible doesn't have time to consider loss. The only way is forward.",
    "80BBFC50": "What do you see when you look at the phantom cities of Mars? I see the Crucible.",
    "80BBFC52": "We have to act immediately. Red Legion is everywhere.",
    "80BBFC56": "The Shard this, the Shard that. What about the Crucible?",
    "80BD1139": "What do you mean you can't concentrate when I'm yelling? Relax!",
    "80BD113B": "Stop. I've seen enough. Come back when you're ready.",
    "80BD113D": "This match would be funny if it weren't so embarassing, Guardian.",
    "80BBFC58": "Our work is unfinished, Guardian. What can I do?",
    "80BBFC5A": "The world is burning. We need you out there.",
    "80BBFC5C": "I'm hungry for news, Guardian. ",
    "80BBFC5E": "What news from the warfront?",
    "80BBFC60": "What's going on out there? Talk to me, Guardian.",
    "80BD113F": "Crucible needs me, Guardian. Are you ready to deploy?",
    "80BD1141": "Damage reports are coming in across the system. My Redjacks are spooked.",
    "80BD1143": "As many lives as it takes, Warlock! No excuses in the Crucible.",
    "80BD1145": "Exquisite work, Titan. Show me more.",
    "80BD1147": "Not good enough, Titan. This war is relentless.",
    "80BD1149": "I know you can make this work, Hunter. Be fast.",
    "80BD114B": "Get out of your own way, Guardian, and you will excel.",
    "80BD114D": "Learn to duck, Guardian. Maybe you'll get to keep your head.",
    "80BD114F": "And what do you think would happen, rookie, if the Guardians at Six Fronts just gave up? I'll tell you—you'd be dead!",
    "80BD115F": "You're stronger than this, Warlock. Prove it.",
    "80BD1165": "You can crush them, Titan. So crush them.",
    "80BD1167": "When you fall, you rise, Titan. Do you hear me?",
    "80BD1169": "Time to fight, Guardian. What do you need?",
    "80BD116B": "Always good to see another hero of the Tower.",
    "80BD116D": "Ah, one of our brightest returns.",
    "80BD116F": "The Crucible beckons, Guardian. Will you answer?",
    "80BD1171": "You're alive, Guardian. Fight like it.",
    "80BD1173": "Why can't those rookies in the Crucible be more like you?",
    "80BD1175": "Tell me. You don't fear Vanguard operations. Do you fear the Crucible?",
    "80BD1177": "Did you show the Darkness what Light can do?",
    "80BBFCA0": "Given time, Darkness will encroach again. We have to be ready.",
    "80FF507A": "Victory smells nice, Guardian. But the Red Legion's not gone.",
    "80FF507C": "Crucible gets harsher everyday. It has to. I make sure of it.",
    "80FF507E": "Talk to me, Guardian. Rumor has it all hell has broken loose.",
    "80FF5080": "I have an entire Crucible to officiate, Guardian. Don't make me wait.",
    "80FF5082": "I know you're a busy Guardian, but the Crucible needs veterans now more than ever. ",
    "80FF5084": "The EDZ needs our help, Guardian. Get out there.",
    "80FF5086": "You're doing your part out there, I hope. But the Crucible always needs more fighters.",
    "80BD1179": "I know you'll use this well.",
    "80BD117D": "This was made for you.",
    "80BD1181": "Don't waste it.",
    "80BD1183": "Careful with that.",
    "80BD1185": "Hopefully this is as sturdy as you are.",
    "80BD1187": "I expect this to be broken and battered by sundown.",
    "80BD1189": "For you. Fight well.",
    "80BD118B": "Powerful gear for a powerful Guardian.",
    "80BD118D": "The gear makes the Guardian.",
    "80BD118F": "Keep this safe, and it'll keep you safe.",
    "80BD1191": "Well fought. This is yours, now.",
    "80BD1193": "Take it. It's yours.",
    "80BD1195": "This is rare, but if it breaks, it breaks.",
    "80BD1197": "Careful with this, I— Actually, I don't care.",
    "80BD1199": "I hope you feel your hard work paid off.",
    "80BD119D": "I'd be right there with you if these rookies could just learn to fight by themselves.",
    "80BD11BE": "There's a love of the fight in you, I think. Come back any time.",
    "80BD11C0": "All battles are just a lesson, Guardian.",
    "80BD11C2": "Be safe out there, Guardian.",
    "80BD11C4": "Even steel needs sharpening. Don't stray too long.",
    "80BD11C6": "On your way, Guardian.",
    "80BD11C8": "Be swift out there, Hunter. Let nothing hold you back.",
    "80BD11CA": "Come back safe, Hunter. You're one of the good ones.",
    "80BD11CC": "Come see me when you bring your Light home, Titan.",
    "80BD11CE": "Stop by when you return, Titan. We'll trade punches. I'll let you go first.",
    "80BD11D0": "Don't lurk about, Warlock. Until next time.",
    "80BD11D2": "I value your opinions, Warlock. Let's talk again.",
    "80BBFCED": "Got something for ya.",
    "80BBFCF1": "Definitely gonna need your help with this.",
    "80BBFCF3": "You're here! Perfect timing.",
    "80BBFCF7": "I just know you're the right Guardian for this.",
    "80BBFCF9": "So! Funny story? Got a job for you right here.",
    "80BBFCFB": "You've always wanted to do a job for me, right?",
    "80BBFCFD": "You and me are gonna fix a thing, Guardian.",
    "80BBFCFF": "We have work to do. And by we, I mostly mean you.",
    "80BBFD01": "Guar. Dee. An. How the heck are ya?",
    "80BD11D4": "Everybody's restin' just a little bit easier, thanks to you.",
    "80BD11F3": "Good work out there in the wilds! ",
    "80BD11F5": "Nice work out there, Guardian. Real nice work.",
    "80BD11F7": "You did good out there. Just remember, I got your back.",
    "80BD11F9": "You never stop surprising me, Guardian. Keep it up.",
    "80BD11FB": "Just read the after-action on your little battle. ",
    "80BD11FD": "Can't stop doing what you do, huh? Hmm hmm hmm.",
    "80BD11FF": "You just  man alive, you just mopped the floor with them. Nice work, Guardian!",
    "80BD1201": "You're my favorite. Shh. Don't tell anyone.",
    "80BD1203": "You want me to say well done? That ya did good? Well done.",
    "80BD1205": "You never let em' see you sweat. That's the way, Guardian.",
    "80BD1207": "We can't afford to let em' hold ground. Good work.",
    "80BD1209": "Nice work, Guardian. Keep the ground clear out there.",
    "80BD120B": "You did the thing out there! Thanks, Guardian.",
    "80BBFD15": "I ain't got all day.",
    "80BBFD17": "If you're looking for the Cryptarch, he ain't here.",
    "80BBFD19": "Hey, you gonna buy something or ?",
    "80BBFD1B": "Let's get started.",
    "80BBFD1D": "You still with me?",
    "80BBFD1F": "And what?",
    "80BBFD21": "Come on. Let's go.",
    "80BBFD23": "Move it or lose it, buddy.",
    "80BBFD39": "I'm still here. You still there? ",
    "80BBFD3B": "I just kinda wanna poke ya now.",
    "80BBFD3D": "Tower to Guardian. Come in, Guardian.",
    "80BBFD3F": "Did you just— turn off or something?",
    "80BBFD41": "Last week I was down at this little cantina in the bazaar and a Titan bigger than Zavala challenged me to an arm wrestle. I won, of course. It's always— you know, it's leverage.",
    "80BBFD43": "Hey, if you ever see stuff from the Fallen Houses down in the City let me know, 'k? Stuff is getting hard to find out there.",
    "80BBFD45": "Hey, do me a favor? Ask Banshee to send up one of those Omolon catalogs next time you see him. I want to treat myself. ",
    "80BBFD47": "There's nothing like the freedom of a long patrol, Guardian. Just you, your Ghost, your Sparrow, and the horizon.",
    "80BBFD49": "Most folk just see Ikora's calm and collected side these days. You shoulda known her back in her Crucible days. You think she's scary now? Hoo!",
    "80BBFD4B": "Zavala talks all serious and curmudgeonly, but deep down I know he appreciates the, uh, unique perspective I bring to Vanguard meetings.",
    "80BBFD4D": "Amanda Holliday is a rapscallion and a liar. Don't listen to a thing she says about me. 'Specially if it's about me and a certain Queen of Hearts.",
    "80BBFD4F": "You ever find yourself looking up at the end of a firefight and asking, 'Now, who started that again?'",
    "80BBFD51": "Y'know, I used to think the Vanguard was a bad fit for a Hunter. But I'm doing some good up here, and there are endless opportunities to bug Zavala. So.",
    "80BBFD53": "Get a load of this report I read last week. Kid detected a huge free-floating mass on the edge of the system. He approached, and the thing moved! Tentacles, beaks, all kinds of things. Went jetting off into the Kuiper belt faster than he could follow. Damndest thing, right?",
    "80BBFD55": "Reading reports ain't as good as flyin' or shootin', but my Hunters keep me mighty entertained. Someday I'll be back out there, but right now my place is right here.",
    "80BBFD57": "I've been places and done things that'd turn your Ghost inside out. But Guardian, I tell you, the reports Shiro's sending back to me are wow.",
    "80BBFD59": "Next time you're out Shiro's way, pop a couple of Vex in the juicebox; tell 'em Cayde sent ya.",
    "80BBFD5B": "You know I've got a six after my name, right? You ever catch yourself wondering what the other yous were like?",
    "80BBFD5D": "If you're wondering how I stay so shiny, check out this little place down in the bazaar. They make an exo wax, special recipe. I swear by it.",
    "80BBFD5F": "You lose power to your leg servos? I hear ya. I got a bad coupling in my leg that gives me fits some nights.",
    "80BBFD61": "Watch your back, shoot straight, conserve ammo, and never, ever, cut a deal with a Warlock.",
    "80BBFD63": "You got any tales to tell, Hunter? That's why I'm here. Start talking.",
    "80BBFD65": "When you're in a fireteam, and you've got a, a Titan or a Warlock with you, you gotta—you know—go easy on 'em. They're helping too. After a fashion.",
    "80BBFD67": "Oh, hey, ain't you the strong, silent type. Does, uh, Zavala give you a seminar on that or?",
    "80BBFD69": "Titan, no joking. I'm sure you're very good at—whatever it is you do. But if you're ever in the field, annd you get scared, don't feel bad calling in a Hunter. No shame asking for help.",
    "80BBFD6B": "So. I'm looking at your shoulderplates and I get how they make them that big. I've just always wondered why? Why?",
    "80BBFD6D": "Are you— Are you talking to Ikora right now? Can she see through your eyes—Ikora! I did not steal your mug! That was someone else! Mine's got my name on it. I'd never do that. You know me. ",
    "80BBFD6F": "Warlock, no joking. I'm sure you're very good at— whatever it is you do. But if you're ever in the field, and you don't know something, don't feel bad calling in a Hunter. No shame in asking for help.",
    "80BBFD71": "So do you Warlocks sleep standing up? I saw Ikora do that a few times. Always gives me the heebie-jeebies.",

    "80BBFD8F": "What can I do you for, Hunter?",
    "80BBFD91": "Oh, this is gonna be good, isn't it?",
    "80BBFD93": "Heh-hey! Mud on your boots, Hunter. You need something?",
    "80BBFD95": "Looking for gear, Hunter?",
    "80BBFD97": "Hey, Titan! What can I do for ya?",
    "80BBFD99": "Huh, Titan. You're a big one. What can I do for you?",

    "80BBFDBF": "I'm here, I'm awake, I'm all yours.",
    "80BBFDC1": "Hmm. Gonna need to set up more supply drops; old ones are all tapped out.",
    "80BBFDC3": "OK Hmm No, no. That's not it.",
    "80BBFDC5": "Have something for me?",
    "80BBFDC7": "I bet you got stories. ",
    "80BBFDC9": "Kill anything interesting lately?",

    "80FF508A": "Would you write up a tactical report? I would like to study your methods.",
    "80FF508C": "You have survived where others have not. A testament to you and to those who have fallen.",
    "80BBFE54": "No time for indecision. The City depends on us.",
    "80BBFE56": "I would like to offer the City some good news, for a change.",
    "80FF508E": "It's all right. Take a moment to enjoy this victory. You've earned it.",
    "80BBFE60": "Did you need something?",
    "80BBFE62": "You seem like you've got something on your mind.",
    "80BBFE64": "We choose our words carefully, you and I. As it should be.",
    "80FF5090": "You have learned to appreciate silence, I see. Good.",
    "80FF5092": "Old Earth poetry describes the Moon as a thing of beauty. But to me it will always be a tomb.",
    "80FF5094": "I never thought I would abandon the City, the walls. That hurt more than I can say. But we saved so many lives with that decision. I would do it again, Guardian. In a second.",
    "80FF5096": "The City stood as a beacon, unbowed, for so long. It fell to the Red Legion as I stood watch. Never again, Guardian.",
    "80FF5098": "We have been through so much, but I worry that Ikora has suffered the most. She is strong—stronger than any of us—but unaccustomed to leaning on others.",
    "80FF509A": "Dead Orbit, New Monarchy, the Future War Cult. I relied on the Speaker's voice to balance the scales of consensus for so long. Now, how will we find our path forward?",
    "80FF509C": "The people of the City will never look on us the same way again. We are not gods. We were never gods. Perhaps, in some ways, this is all for the best. ",
    "80FF509E": "The Tower was my home. I could walk its halls with my eyes closed, tell you where I was merely by how the deckplates moved beneath my feet. All of this will take some getting used to.",
    "80FF50A0": "I wish I could tell you what I felt about the Speaker, Guardian. His death—no one deserves that. But in the end, what kind of man was he? What has he left behind?",
    "80FF50A2": "The Traveler chose us. That choice lives with us, every day. It lives in your breast and mine. It drives us. We must be equal to that choice. We must stand in the Light and be worthy of the title: Guardian.",

    "80FF50A6": "The Golden Age technology on Titan could change our world forever. If we hold our ground, we may yet reclaim our birthright.",
    "80FF50A8": "Sloane has been my right hand for as long as I can remember. I still remember our days spent planning and building the Wall. Stoneborn, indeed.",
    "80FF50AA": "I know you think you're following the right path, but it will only lead to more ruin.",
    "80FF50AC": "The list of names only grows. Cayde-6—you are in nobler company now.",

    "80FF50B2": "Ahamkara do not really die after they've been killed. That's what makes them so difficult to eradicate.",
    "80FF50B4": "There's a reason we chose to hunt the Ahamkara to extinction.",
    "80FF50B6": "The fight for the Dreaming City is Sisyphean. We should focus on fights that we can actually win.",
    "80FF50B8": "Mara Sov, alive after all this time. Incredible. I didn't think it possible.",
    "80FF50BA": "I hope we can work together again in the future, Guardian. Our differences should not stand between us.",
    "80FF50BC": "No, we cannot take nominations for a new Hunter Vanguard. The Dare still stands.",
    "80FF50BE": "Much as it would have pleased him, I will not nominate the Colonel as Hunter Vanguard in Cayde's place. Stop asking.",
    "80FF50C0": "What next on the horizon?",
    "80FF50C2": "If you're still mourning Cayde, you might also spare a glance for the thousands of other Guardians who gave their lives so that this City would never fall. ",
    "80FF50C4": "O proud death, what feast is toward in thine eternal cell, that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck?",
    "80FF50C6": "What's yet in this, that bears the name of life? Yet in this life lie hid more thousand deaths: yet death we fear, that makes these odds all even. ",
    "80C93890": "You are feeling the draw of the Reef as well? I sympathize, but you must learn to look beyond that.",
    "80FF50C8": "Our people stand beside the Exos and the Humans. We stand together as the people of the City. The people of the Traveler.  ",
    "80C93894": "I am often uncomfortable with your people. With Hunters. You move too much. Unnerving.",
    "80FF50CA": "Do you ever get tired of bearing the weight of that cloak, Guardian? Yes yes, sometimes I do as well.",
    "80C93898": "The walls once defined us, Titan. Now, we must be the wall. We must stand against the Darkness and prove the Traveler's choice a wise one.",
    "80C9389A": "You, I understand, Titan. You think as I do. Warlocks and Hunters, they are not still. They are not centered, as we are.",
    "80C9389C": "I will not always be here to carry the Vanguard upon my shoulders. One day, another Titan will have to bear the weight. Perhaps you?",
    "80C9389E": "If Ikora asked you to look in on me, you can tell her I'm fine.",
    "80C938A0": "The Pujari-Wei ratio is just a bad joke. I have enormous respect for Warlocks.",
    "80C938A2": "You bear the mantle of Warlock with dignity and strength. Make Ikora proud, Guardian. Prove the Traveler's choice a wise one.",
    "80FF50CC": "I hear you're working with Ada. Her weapons could be of great use to us.",
    "80FF50CE": "I had my doubts about Ada. But a partnership with the Black Armory could be a boon for the Vanguard.",
    "80FF50D0": "Ikora tells me Ada is opening up to us. You've done good work, Guardian.",
    "80FF50D2": "The Armory is keeping us well supplied with powerful weaponry. We owe this to you.",
    "80FF50D4": "The Drifter's experiments are a liability. Be vigilant.",
    "80FF50D6": "The Drifter's activities are troubling. Watch him closely, and keep us informed.",
    "80FF50D8": "We cannot turn a blind eye to the Derelict. Learn all you can.",
    "80FF50DA": "I'm struggling to understand how the Drifter earned your trust, Guardian.",
    "80FF50DC": "Trust is a two-way street. You'd be wise to remember that.",
    "80FF50DE": "I know you have your reasons for aligning with the Drifter. I just can't imagine what they are.",
    "80FF50E0": "You have the glow of ill-gotten gains about you. I hope you know what you're doing.",
    "80FF50E2": "You might remind Benedict that few activities in the Tower go unnoticed.",
    "80FF50E4": "I won't ask you to stop meeting with Calus. But if you find yourself in trouble, remember who your friends are.",
    "80FF50E6": "Keep a close eye on Eris, Guardian. ",
    "80FF50E8": "You've faced much, Guardian. More than most. But don't let your fears consume you.",
    "80FF50EA": "Whatever's been awoken down there in the dark, we can overcome. Believe. As I do.",
    "80FF50EC": "I rest easier knowing you're out there contending with the Nightmares, Guardian.",
    "80FF50EE": "No Nightmares in the Last City—not yet. Thanks to you.",
    "80FF50F0": "We face a future more uncertain than ever. But we face it together.",
    "80FF50F2": "Guardian. Report.",
    "80FF50F4": "Guardian, report.",
    "80FF50F6": "Come forward.",
    "80FF50F8": "Anything to report?",
    "80FF50FA": "Yes?",

    "80FF510E": "I have always defended the City's best interests. Can you say the same?",
    "80FF5110": "Guardians are meant to protect the City.",
    "80FF5112": "Are you here to resume your post as a Guardian of this City?",
    "80FF5114": "If you are here for another fight I don't have it in me today.",
    "80FF5116": "I understand how you feel. Did you even try to understand how I feel?",
    "80FF5118": "If we win this war, it will be thanks to you.",

    "80BBFF42": "Where did you get this warrior spirit?",
    "80BBFF44": "Another successful operation in the books. Well done.",
    "80BBFF46": "We'll have need of you again soon. Stay on your toes.",
    "80BBFF48": "Your fireteam today, were they close friends?",
    "80BBFF4A": "I couldn't have done it better if I were in the field. Very nice work.",
    "80BBFF4C": "You and your fireteam—are you close? You should be.",
    "80BBFF4E": "Another day, another operation. Your dedication thrills me.",
    "80BBFF50": "Farewell.",
    "80BBFF52": "Remember what we fight for.",
    "80BBFF54": "Be brave.",
    "80BBFF56": "As you were.",
    "80BBFF58": "Back to the front, Guardian.",
    "80BBFF5A": "Stay sharp, Hunter.",
    "80BBFF5C": "Always have a trick up your sleeve, Hunter.",
    "80BBFF5E": "Stay strong, Titan. ",
    "80BBFF60": "Be the one who moves, not the one who is moved.",
    "80BBFF67": "Will you aid us, Guardian?",
    "80BBFF6B": "A challenge, if you have the will.",
    "80BBFF6D": "This is within your power.",
    "80BBFF6F": "You are my hope.",
    "80BBFF71": "We trust you with this.",
    "80BBFF73": "A new challenge awaits you, Guardian.",
    "80BBFF75": "I know your Light is equal to this task.",
    "80BBFF77": "Will you add this to your legend?",
    "80BBFF79": "My mind is in a thousand places. I can speak to you as well.",
    "80BBFF7B": "Nothing, then? Are you sure? I think otherwise.",
    "80BBFF7D": "I am here. Enough of me, anyway.",
    "80BBFF7F": "Speak, quickly.",
    "80BBFF81": "Take time to understand the world around you. ",
    "80BBFF83": "Perhaps a short repose would do us all good.",
    "80BBFF85": "What else can you do, I wonder? ",
    "80BBFF87": "Did you forget why you came here? ",
    "80BBFF95": "You have challenged yourself. Walk tall, Guardian.",
    "80BBFF97": "What have you learned from this challenge today?",
    "80BBFF99": "Yes, well done! Challenge yourself again tomorrow.",
    "80BBFF9B": "I knew you were capable of this. And so much more.",
    "80BBFF9D": "You are a credit to the City! Hold your head high today.",
    "80BBFF9F": "I believed you capable of this. And now you realize it, as well.",
    "80BBFFA1": "Remember this day, Guardian. Remember how you stood tall.",
    "80BD1282": "You have returned with fresh perspective!",
    "80BD1286": "Learn from what you have seen, Guardian. Learn well.",
    "80BD1288": "Do not rest easy. Think on what you have seen. And learn from it!",
    "80BD128A": "I knew you were up to this task. Meditation is not for everyone.",
    "80BD128C": "You have acquired a new truth about an old challenge. ",
    "80C93903": "I'm here. I'll always be here.",
    "80C93904": "Don't do this. Don't be aloof. We've lost Cayde we mustn't lose each other. ",
    "80C93905": "I don't know who will become the next Hunter Vanguard. I don't want to think about it.",
    "80C93906": "Something momentous is happening in the Reef. The Taken War never truly ended.",
    "80C93907": "No one will fault you if you need to take time for yourself.",
    "80C93908": "I am working on my patience, Guardian. This war has been instructive.",
    "80C9390A": "Are you with me, Guardian? Or are you far beyond Earth? On a distant, ice-rimed shoreline with stars above that mock and call out to you?",
    "80C9390C": "Tess told me I should try something different with my hair. I told her she should try something different with hers. She didn't like that.",
    "80C9390E": "What if there was a fourth energy? Void, Solar, Arc, and what. I sometimes tire of all these threes.",
    "80C93910": "Does your mind stretch to the edge of our solar system like mine, Guardian? Do you seek the places where the Light cannot find purchase? I understand.",
    "80C93912": "What troubles you, Guardian? Did you misplace a Viridian Engram, somewhere in the untamed wilds of our system?",
    "80C93914": "Why do you hesitate? There are no enemies here. Unless do you see one that I do not?",
    "80C93916": "You're the one we can count on, Guardian. To strike at that which others fear. ",
    "80C93918": "I feel a pull sometimes, Guardian. Beyond Earth. Beyond Mars. Even beyond the Reef. But not too far beyond.",
    "80C9391A": "Your success against our strongest enemies is inspiring to most. But take care of those who covet that power. Envy is dangerous.",
    "80C9391C": "The minds of the Vex fascinate and terrify me. Use your time on Io wisely, Guardian. Learn with Asher, and report back to me.",
    "80C9391E": "I'm not THAT intimidating.",
    "80C93920": "Guardian, are you lost?",
    "80C93922": "Use your words.",
    "80C93924": "Ah, a spy! Sent by one of the Orders?",
    "80C93926": "Oh come on. I don't turn people into frogs, whatever you've heard.",
    "80C93928": "The history of humanity is riddled with inaction. Our ancestors waited for greatness to happen to them. And then they died.",
    "80C9392A": "I am told the people of the City speak my name in hushed whispers. That's all right. I don't need to be loved to do what I do.",
    "80C9392C": "When I walk the alleys of the bazaar, I smile. This place is for humanity, as much as for we Guardians.",
    "80C9392E": "I once taught Eris Morn secrets from the Warlock orders. I might do the same for another Hunter someday.",
    "80C93930": "I sometimes wonder how the universe might be different if Hunters had not chosen to embrace their gift. Perhaps we would have exterminated you?",
    "80C93932": "Zavala once stood still for eight straight days. No Titan has ever eclipsed his record. Be brave.",
    "80C93934": "Could the Warlocks have built the Wall by themselves? Probably not. Or at least, there would have been far more headaches and nosebleeds.",
    "80C93936": "When Zavala speaks to you of duty, of sacrifice, know that it comes with long years of serious thought and consideration. Try, if you can, not to yawn. ",
    "80C93938": "Hearing voices? We all do, from time to time. They're mostly on our side.",
    "80C9393A": "Given enough time, all the mysteries of the universe can be yours, Warlock. Be brave.",
    "80C9393C": "Pondering the nature of the universe, Guardian? Warlocks have done so for hundreds of years. Most of them, anyway.",
    "80C9393E": "Before his accident, Asher was the most promising scribe in our ranks. His single-minded pursuit has unlocked astonishing truths about the Vex.",
    "80FFF3DA": "Ada harbors a deep distrust of Guardians, but I hear she's taken a shine to you.",
    "80FFF3DC": "Forge any breathtaking instruments of war lately, Guardian?",
    "80FFF3DE": "I'm no fan of secretive organizations operating under our noses. But your work with Ada appears to be paying off.",
    "80FFF3E0": "From what my Hidden have gathered, Ada could be a valuable ally.",
    "80FFF3E2": "Keep both eyes on the Drifter for us. Discreetly.",
    "80FFF3E4": "Loyalty to the Vanguard does not go unrewarded, Guardian. Be our eyes.",
    "80FFF3E6": "Don't let the Drifter's name-calling get to you. You're working in service of something greater.",
    "80FFF3E8": "The Drifter deals with forces beyond his control. What he's doing—what you're doing—is dangerous.",
    "80FFF3EA": "Your wilting loyalty to the Vanguard is not going unnoticed.",
    "80FFF3EC": "If you expect us to trust you, we expect you to do the same. It's that simple.",
    "80FFF3EE": "If you insist on wasting precious hours with Calus, I insist you don't let the wretch rub off on you.",
    "80FFF3F0": "Rumor is you've been spending a lot of time with Benedict.",
    "80FFF3F2": "I've heard disquieting rumors about your associations with Calus. You have our trust, but just be careful.",
    "80FFF3F4": "The nightmare slayer, in the flesh.",
    "80FFF3F6": "Still more questions requiring still more answers.",
    "80FFF3F8": "I've long insisted to Zavala that trust in the Vanguard can be restored. I think he's finally beginning to believe me.",
    "80FFF3FA": "The whispers are relentless. Don't listen to them, Guardian. Keep your mind clear.",
    "80FFF3FC": "Without you, this City would be overrun by horrors. We are grateful. All of us.",
    "80FFF3FE": "The nightmares are out there, Guardian. Find them. Slay them.",
    "80FFF400": "What news from the moon, Guardian?",
    "80FFF402": "A great unknown looms over us. No—it beckons us.",
    "80FFF404": "The Hive are stirring, Guardian.",
    "80FFF406": "Watch Eris's back, Guardian. She's surely watching yours.",
    "80FFF408": "A little closer, Guardian.",
    "80FFF40A": "What is it?",
    "80FFF40C": "What is it?",
    "80FFF40E": "I must have lost track of time. Hello, Guardian.",
    "80FFF410": "What news of the war?",
    "80FFF412": "Good to see you.",
    "80FFF414": "Beautiful, isn't it?",
    "80FFF416": "I can spare a minute or two.",
    "80FFF418": "My mind seeks our next threat. But I still have time for you.",
    "80FFF41A": "Perhaps the harmony in the Tower can lead to unity in the Warlock Orders. Perhaps not.",
    "80FFF41C": "Let the Reef know I will do whatever I can to support them. ",
    "80FFF41E": "I don't begrudge Petra anything. The past is the past.",
    "80FFF420": "Send it on. The Reef needs it more than we do.",
    "80FFF422": "Isolation is death. The Reef is learning this in the worst possible way. ",
    "80FFF424": "What news from the Reef?",
    "80FFF426": "No, I will not speak at your Cayde-6 memorial. Why? Because he would have hated that. Toast him, and then move on. ",
    "80FFF428": "I don't know what we're going to do without him. I really don't.",
    "80FFF42A": "It's all falling apart. The Vanguard, the fireteam the future we imagined. ",
    "80FFF42C": "Avenge him, Guardian. I wish I could go with you, but I'll cover for you here. Avenge him for both of us. ",
    "80FFF42E": "I knew Uldren's death wouldn't make me feel better. But I thought it would make me feel something.",
    "80FFF430": "Osiris comes back into my life and then Cayde leaves it. I'd like to discern some kind of cosmic meaning from this, but sometimes there are no answers.",
    "80FFF432": "I rarely see Zavala outside of Consensus meetings anymore. I'm trying to be patient, but sometimes he acts like he's the only one who's ever known grief. ",
    "80FFF434": "I'd like to go watch a Doubles match.",
    "80FFF436": "I hope you and your Double are doing me proud in the Crucible.",
    "80FFF438": "Happy Dawning, Guardian.",
    "80FFF43A": "The Dawning always brings the promise of a happier future.",
    "80FFF43C": "I felt your approach, Guardian. I believe we share a connection.",
    "80FFF43E": "We were there at the beginning. You and I will be there at the end.",
    "80FFF440": "Do you come for advice, Guardian?  I may have what you seek.",
    "80FFF442": "Tell me what you've seen, Hunter.",
    "80FFF444": "Others may not have heard you approach. Well done, Hunter.",
    "80FFF446": "Hunter. Tell me of the wilderness you've walked.",
    "80FFF448": "Titan. Let us work together. You can learn much from the Warlocks.",
    "80FFF44A": "We are all warriors, but the City looks to the Titans. Don't take that lightly.",
    "80FFF44C": "You have questions, Titan?",
    "80FFF44E": "Welcome home, Warlock. Let us speak.",
    "80FFF450": "Good to see you here.",
    "80FFF452": "My friend and ally.",
    "80FFF454": "Ah, a Warlock I don't have to worry about. Good.",
    "80FFF456": "This enemy seeks to turn our burdens against us. Our anguish. Perhaps it's time we lay them down.",
    "80FFF458": "It's no longer a question of 'if' the Collapse will return. It's a question of 'when.'",
    "80FFF45A": "These Nightmares won't stop. They'll use our every trauma against us.",
    "80FFF45C": "We've faced our fears. Now we punish those who used them against us.",
    "80FFF45E": "We finally have our foothold on the Moon. Now we have to keep it.",
    "80FFF460": "Cayde, could you come—ah. [clears throat] ",
    "80FFF462": "Cayde owed him how much? [sigh] Tell him to see me. I'll pay what he owed. The Spider makes bold claims, but not without evidence. ",
    "80FFF464": "We don't yet fully understand what that Pyramid is, or what it can do.",
    "80FFF466": "What if she—no. Eris is strong. She will be fine.",
    "80FFF468": "Steady your mind. Stare down your fear. This is a fight you've won before—you can do it again.",
    "80FFF46A": "Our deepest wounds, turned against us",
    "80FFF46C": "I hope Eris is holding herself together.",
    "80FFF46E": "Again, nothing.",
    "80FFF470": "Was that... no, not possible.",
    "80FFF472": "Where are those new student files?",
    "80FFF474": "Away, Darkness. I have no time for you now.",
    "80FFF476": "The Thanatonauts? A surge? No.",
    "80FFF478": "How did you do it, Osiris?",
    "80FFF47A": "Symmetry is not sufficient. Not anymore.",
    "80FFF47C": "Light and Dark are harmonic pairings. But what does it mean?",
    "80FFF47E": "Everything ends. The question is: how?",
    "80FFF480": "A glimpse, and then gone. And that is all it was.",
    "80FFF482": "No time for that now. You know better.",
    "80FFF484": "I will hold the Orders together. With my teeth, if I have to.",
    "80FFF486": "It grows stronger with each passing second. Stronger stronger.",
    "80FFF488": "A long-range strike at the Empire cascading Nova Bombs? Hmm.",
    "80FFF48A": "Great power still lingers on Io. The Traveler is not so unlike us, in that way. Even a brief touch can leave a lasting impression.",
    "80FFF48C": "Can Mercury be saved? An alliance with the Vex? He would never allow it.",
    "80FFF48E": "I don't understand. Why can't you tell me where you are? We can send whatever help you need.",
    "80FFF490": "Keep at it, Chalco. I need answers.",
    "80FFF492": "Take it. I've already memorized it. ",
    "80FFF494": "Tell me what you and Eris have learned.",
    "80FFF496": "What secrets have you uncovered?",
    "80FFF498": "The Moon beckons, Guardian.",
    "80FFF49A": "I breathe easier knowing you and Eris are out there.",
    "80FFF49C": "Pardon me. These are troubling times.",
    "80FFF49E": "The Pyramid signals the rise of a dreadful tide. We must beat it back.",
    "80FFF4A0": "We'll make them pay for turning our wounds against us.",
    "80FFF4A2": "The Nightmares will not relent. Neither can we.",
    "80FFF4A4": "You have my full faith and trust, Guardian. You and Eris both. ",
    "80FFF4A6": "We'll crush these would-be 'saviors' together, Guardian.",
    "80FFF4A8": "Excuse me. My mind was somewhere else.",
    "80FFF4AA": "We must know more.",
    "80FFF4AC": "Do you have knowledge to share?",
    "80FFF4AE": "What have you learned, Guardian?",
    "80FFF4B0": "I know you are capable.",
    "80FFF4B2": "Up, out of the dark.",
    "80FFF4B4": "You have questions?",
    "80FFF4B6": "Hmm.",
    "80BD0037": "Anything you need?",
    "80BD0039": "How can the Vanguard help?",
    "80BD003B": "What do you seek?",
    "80BD003D": "Welcome.",
    "80BD003F": "Yes, Guardian?",
    "80BD0041": "What can you teach me?",
    "80BD0043": "Quickly, friend.",
    "80BD0045": "Your Light has not gone out.",
    "80FFF4B8": "The Darkness is once again on our doorstep.",
    "80FFF4BA": "The lunar Hive's nightmare rituals will continue. We cannot abide this.",
    "80FFF4BC": "I suppose many of us are losing sleep these days.",
    "80FFF4BE": "'Your salvation,' it says. A bald-faced lie.",
    "80FFF4C0": "This is but a glimpse of the test to come. We'll be ready. ",
    "80FFF4C2": "We have to get inside that Pyramid. No matter what danger awaits us.",
    "80FFF4C4": "Even so far from the Moon, I swear I can feel that thing from here. Can't you?",
    "80FFF4C6": "The foul aura emanating from that Pyramid bites at my bones. I can only imagine what Eris felt when it woke up.",
    "80FFF4C8": "Whatever that Pyramid is, it knows what haunts us. It knows our wounds. It knows us.",
    "80FFF4CA": "The Vanguard will survive this. The Last City will survive this.",
    "80FFF4CC": "I am not afraid of the dark.",
    "80FFF4CE": "There is always a path. But the cost",
    "80FFF4D0": "No, of course. Not here.",
    "80FFF4D2": "Patience. We must be centered.",
    "80FFF4D4": "My Hidden are scattered and quiet. I need information, Guardian.",
    "80FFF4D6": "So much knowledge lost in the War. A pity I was so... busy.",
    "80FFF4D8": "I sense him, on the far edges of my mind. He stirs in the vaults. But why?",
    "80FFF4DA": "So many Guardians lost. The Cabal will answer.",
    "80FFF4DC": "We have battles to fight. It can wait.",
    "80FFF4DE": "I will have answers.",
    "80FFF4E0": "The weakness is the center of the shield. Perhaps in the center of their mind",
    "80FFF4E2": "How can you pass on what you have learned to others?",
    "80BD005F": "Very well.",
    "80BD0061": "It's yours.",
    "80BD0063": "May it serve you well, Guardian.",
    "80BD0065": "Then take it.",
    "80BD0067": "Yes, of course.",
    "80BD0069": "It will serve you well.",
    "80BD006B": "Don't forget. This is only a tool.",
    "80BD006D": "Use it well.",
    "80BD006F": "As it should be.",
    "80BD0071": "I know it will be of use.",
    "80BD0073": "We could only trust you with this, Guardian.",
    "80BD0075": "Use it wisely.",
    "80BD0077": "It's nearly as powerful as you are.",
    "80BD0079": "I knew it would find the right owner someday.",
    "80BD007B": "Yes, that WAS the right decision.",
    "80BD007D": "The City fell. The Tower burned. Our Light was lost. Gather your courage, and return to our darkest hour. ",

    "80BD0111": "This star system is TRULY lost if we cannot manage inane tasks like enemy suppression. Well, I say 'we.' I mean, 'you.' Clear them out.",
    "80BD0113": "An interesting pattern is emerging as you so gallantly mow your way through enemy forces. Go on mowing. I will observe.",
    "80BD0115": "My readings indicate a rising trend in enemy activity. It is to our mutual benefit to reverse that trend, wouldn't you say?",
    "80BD0117": "I have a hypothesis about maximizing your utility potential. Prove it. Demonstrate your ability to destroy.",
    "80BD0119": "Ah-ha-hem! Science finds work for idle hands! Do what you do best and go shoot something.",
    "80BD011B": "Ikora has asked me to analyze enemy combat strategies. For that, I need data. Seek conflict, assistant.",
    "80BD011D": "Enemy interference will compromise the potential of my calculations if you do not act quickly! Drive them back!",
    "80BD011F": "Life is but gradual decay into disorder, but there is no reason to simply accept that. Crush your enemies. Establish order.",
    "80BD0121": "There is no time to gallivant around doing nothing of substance! Make yourself useful and suppress the enemy.",
    "80BD0123": "Ikora and I have developed a new theory regarding enemy combat tactics. We need your assistance to validate it.",
    "80BD0125": "The Vex and the Taken have claimed many planets, but Io will not be one of them. Push them back!",
    "80BD0127": "The Vex and the Taken will defile this planet if we do not stop them, Guardian. Cut them down!",
    "80BD0129": "Feel the Light move through you. Do you sense its reaction to your enemies? Hunt them down.",
    "80BD012B": "The creatures infesting Io are growing bolder and bolder. Show them that this is our moon.",
    "80BD012D": "There is no such thing as true combat mastery. The best fighters are always learning. Continue your studies, Guardian.",
    "80BD012F": "Our enemies seek to claim this moon's energy for their own vile purposes. We must not allow it.",
    "80BD0131": "The enemy is rallying. Bring the battle to them before they bring it to us.",
    "80BD0133": "Intelligence indicates that enemy forces are mobilizing. Stop them before they press our forward line.",
    "80BD0135": "Each enemy that you kill brings us one step closer to restoring the purity of this sacred place.",
    "80BD0137": "My agents are reporting an increase in enemy activity in all sectors. Keep your eye out, Guardian.",
    "80BD0139": "We are humanity’s last hope. Every victory here, no matter how small, is meaningful. Help me defend the future.",
    "80BD013B": "I sense a great war on the horizon. Hone your skills against the enemies around you. Make yourself sharp and ready.",
    "80BD016C": "I've detected an unusual pattern in enemy communications. A few on-site scans might yield interesting results.",
    "80BD016E": "My instruments have picked up an abnormal signal. Scan the source of the transmission. I wish to study it.",
    "80BD0170": "Enemy interference is disrupting my calculations! Track it down, assistant! I have no time for such setbacks!",
    "80BD0172": "I've intercepted an anomalous broadcast, but I believe it may be a simulation. Make yourself useful and go scan its origin.",
    "80BD0174": "Are you just WANDERING AROUND? You're in the field; take field readings! Scan something! This isn't a vacation! This is science!",
    "80BD0176": "Despite everything I've learned about the Vex, I fear I'll never know enough. However, a few short-range scans might increase my odds.",
    "80BD0178": "Assistant, I require field scans to better understand this moon. I observe that you are in the field. Therefore, get me scans.",
    "80BD017A": "BAH! Blasted Vex interference! Assistant! I need you to recalibrate my extrasolar arrays. A few manual scans should do it. Hurry now!",
    "80BD017C": "I require manual scans to continue my research. Ikora has suggested you might help if I say 'please.' In conclusion: Please.",
    "80BD017E": "I have no time for the frippery of small talk. Transmitting coordinates for a priority scan.",
    "80BD0180": "My agents have identified a possible breach in enemy technology. Dispatching you for an on-site scan. ",
    "80BD0182": "There is a classified item of interest not far from your current location. Your Ghost can assess its utility via a short-range scan.",
    "80BD0184": "This place is sacred, and yet, we've carelessly forgotten what brought the Traveler here in the first place. Some lessons may still remain.",
    "80BD0186": "Regrettably, I cannot study Io firsthand. But you can be my eyes in the field. Gather scans for me, Guardian.",
    "80BD0188": "As you explore, keep an eye out for objects of interest. Manual scans might be the key to uncovering the mystery of this place.",
    "80BD018A": "Asher is detecting unusual resonance near your current position. Seek it out. Your Ghost may be able to make sense of it.",
    "80BD018C": "I have little insight into the artifacts present on this moon. If you could send back some scans, I would be... most appreciative.",
    "80BD018E": "Enemy broadcast patterns have changed. And, believe it or not, Asher cannot explain why. An on-site scan would help.",
    "80BD0190": "This moon seems desolate, I know. But there are forgotten wonders hidden in everything around you. Your Ghost can uncover them.",
    "80BD0192": "Asher has designed a probe to study Vex technology embedded in the environment around you. Your Ghost can deploy it.",
    "80BD0195": "It sounds inane, but: We don't know what we don't know. Plumb the depths of your naivete, assistant. Survey the area.",
    "80BD0199": "Field work is meaningless without a proper field report. Transmitting survey coordinates now.",
    "80BD019B": "My sensor arrays have failed, AGAIN, and I have a sensitive experiment in progress. I need eyes in the field, immediately. ",
    "80BD019D": "Are you aware of cartography, assistant? Let me phrase it more plainly. Maps. Have you heard of maps? I need one. Survey the area.",
    "80BD019F": "There are many places on this moon that I have not yet explored myself. Find a good vantage point. It will inform my research.",
    "80BD01A1": "We have a whole moon to explore, too little time, and too few explorers. Show me something I haven't seen yet!",
    "80BD01A3": "Our satellites need to be recalibrated. You don't seem to be doing anything important, so... go stand in one place for a while.",
    "80BD01A5": "Your explorations have scratched just a fraction of this moon's surface. Look sharp and take a good look at what is around you.",
    "80BD01A7": "I need boots-on-the-ground confirmation of an urgent intelligence report. Dispatching coordinates now.",
    "80BD01A9": "The enemy may be rallying near your current location. Find a recon point and report back as you're able.",
    "80BD01AB": "Blessed energy flows beneath the surface of this moon. Help us understand where it gathers and why.",
    "80BD01AD": "Some of my agents are inbound with fresh supplies. I'm sending you details on their intended route. Scout it out, confirm it.",
    "80BD01AF": "I want to expand our operations here, but I need solid recon data to develop a strategy. Can I count on your help?",
    "80BD01B1": "I have a reconnaissance mission for you, if you're interested. My other agents are currently preoccupied.",
    "80BD01B3": "Asher claims to understand the creatures here, but I am not ashamed to declare that I... do not. Spy on them. Help me understand.",
    "80BD01B5": "I'm sending you recon coordinates. Asher's sensors indicate unusual activity nearby, but my agents can't confirm the report.",
    "80BD01DA": "My agents have been tracking a priority target, which is apparently... tracking you. Give it something to regret.",
    "80BD01DC": "Each enemy force is only as strong as its leader. Cut a leader down. Make our enemies weak.",
    "80BD01DE": "Our enemies believe that this moon is a safe place to groom new leaders. Prove their ignorance.",
    "80BD01E0": "Your good work isn't going unnoticed, Guardian. The enemy has sent a champion to hunt you. Perhaps they think it will stop us.",
    "80BD01E2": "I have fresh intel on an enemy commander not far from your current location. Sending details to your Ghost now.",
    "80BD01E4": "The creatures here are rallying behind a new leader. Remind them of what we do to enemy leaders.",
    "80BD01E6": "Sending you details regarding a high-priority target. I could send one of my Hidden, but there's no one I trust more than you.",
    "80BD01E8": "A powerful enemy dares to hunt you, Guardian. Destroy it.",
    "80BD01EA": "Although it would be amusing to see this play out as nature intends, I must inform you that an enemy commander is hunting you.",
    "80BD01EC": "Assistant, an enemy of unusual size thirsts for your blood. I will as well, if you do not dispatch it quickly.",
    "80BD01EE": "Ikora's agents have identified a valuable target. I have identified a theory on said target's combat tactics. Confirm it for me.",
    "80BD01F0": "My condition is delicate today, and I am feeling particularly cross. Therefore, I wish to see something die. Something big.",
    "80BD01F2": "I have a hypothesis about the impact of charismatic leaders on reluctant soldiers, present company excluded. Transmitting target details.",
    "80BD01F4": "A noteworthy enemy is tracking you. It is noteworthy only because it is an interruption, and I CANNOT abide interruptions.  ",
    "80BD01F6": "An enemy commander is planning an attack near your current sector. That, however, is not the problem. *I* will be your problem if an attack disrupts my research.",
    "80BD01F8": "Ikora wished for me to pass along a message. I was not listening, so: something, something, kill the valuable target. There. Message relayed.",
    "80BD01FB": "Ha! I've established a link into the Collective, but I can't deploy the virus. A Vex Mind is blocking deeper access.",
    "80BD01FF": "Oh. Probably the one that shwooped the construct! We'll find it.",
    "80BD0201": "I've just lost access to the Collective. Nonetheless, I did manage to release the virus. I imagine the Vex will find this development... rather upsetting.",
    "80BD0203": "That doesn't sound ominous!",
    "80BD0205": "Indeed. We shall allow this experiment to unfold in its own time.",
    "80BD0207": "We destroyed the Mind, Asher.",
    "80BD0209": "Yes, yes. Now return to solid ground, before the Vex reconfigure their thought protocols. Those platforms are about to disappear.",
    "80BD020B": "Asher, we found Vex protecting some kind of construct. It's pumping energy into the ground.",
    "80BD1292": "Do not allow our work to be disturbed!",
    "80BD1296": "Keep the sync plate clear while we establish the connection!",
    "80BD1298": "Something's disrupted the connection. Stay on that plate!",
    "80BD0213": "According to the Collective, the Mind is summoning some sort of... pestilent defense.",
    "80BD0215": "Asher, we followed the Mind to some kind of sync plate.",
    "80BD0217": "How curious. See if you can establish a connection with the Vex Collective. I've designed a virus which might prove... useful.",
    "80BD0219": "A virus, huh. I hope you know what you're doing...",
    "80BD021B": "I hypothesize that the Vex are preparing to fully machinoform this moon.",
    "80BD021D": "Like you do.",
    "80BD021F": "Ah, yes. Laugh it off. The Vex are simply planning to transform every planet in this system into a cog in a vast, inscrutable machine!",
    "80BD0221": "They merely wish to convert every particle of matter on this moon, living or dead, into a radiolarian solid!",
    "80BD0223": "Well, when you put it that way...",
    "80BD0225": "Assistant! Is that you? Vex energy readings are off the charts. Go find out what's happening, and be quick about it!",
    "80BD0227": "Asher, we found a construct injecting something into the ground, but a Vex Mind showed up and... took it.",
    "80BD0229": "The Mind... 'took it'?",
    "80BD022B": "Yep, just... shwoop. Took it. We're tracking it now.",
    "80BD0230": "Shadows grow darker in the presence of Light. Fight back, Guardian!",
    "80BD0234": "Hurry! Whatever is on the other side of that veil has to know you're trying to seal it in.",
    "80BD0236": "Ikora, something's coming through.",
    "80BD0238": "How deliciously unexpected.",
    "80BD023C": "Guardian. My agents report that the Taken are gathering at a Cabal camp near your current position, but we have no idea why. I would appreciate your insight.",
    "80BD023E": "So what if the Taken are gathering? They're not bothering us. With a little peace and quiet, I might be able to do some real work.",
    "80BD0240": "The Taken are an army without a commander, Asher. If we leave them 'with a little peace and quiet,' they might crown a new king.",
    "80BD0242": "We found a scary portal. Reminds me of the ones we saw on the Dreadnaught.",
    "80BD0244": "We found a scary portal... It's big; it's full of stars; and it smells like ozone.",
    "80BD0246": "A Portal to the Ascendant Realm. The Taken world lies beyond that veil. A new power must be seeking entrance into our world.",
    "80BD0248": "We've got it. Now what?",
    "80BD024A": "Bring it to that portal. You're fighting entropy with order here. Move!",
    "80BD024C": "I'm pretty sure that's our whole job description.",
    "80BD024E": "Hey, team? The screaming thing from the abyss is dead.",
    "80BD0250": "That creature was the servant of some higher power. I fear something has claimed Oryx's crown.",
    "80BD0252": "Yes, yes. Let's move on. Your intuitions were correct; mine were not. And the Guardian's prowess in battle was... adequate. ",
    "80BD0256": "You should be able to directly manipulate Io's hyperparticle dimensions to collapse the portal.",
    "80BF4A9D": "Sorry, what?",
    "80BD025A": "Your hands! Use your hands to pick up the energy!",
    "80BD025D": "You know, I'm going to be really disappointed if this is all just an elaborate trap to kill us.",
    "80BD0261": "There's a message encrypted in this music.",
    "80BD0263": "Got it. Some kind of quotation. 'Real things in the darkness seem no realer than dreams.'",
    "80BD0265": "Asher! Can you run an archive query for us? ...Asher? ... Channel's down. I'll run the query myself.",
    "80BD0267": "Weaponized music... Creepy quotations... All signs point to Rasputin, but. I don't understand how he could be here.",
    "80BD0269": "This AI is incredible. It weaponized music, and it led us here deliberately. I just don't understand why. What is it trying to tell us?",
    "80BD026B": "There's another old quotation encoded here: 'Misdirected by accident or intent, intelligence can foster its own ecstasies of growth and decay.' ",
    "80BD026D": "The weird thing is, this audio file was just updated. So... this can't be a time capsule.  Someone's trying to talk to us.",
    "80BD026F": "No, no. Some thing. This has to be an AI, right? An old Golden Age AI. Like Failsafe",
    "80BD0271": "This one says, 'Once war has been undertaken, no peace is made by pretending there is no war.'",
    "80BD0273": "What does that mean, 'by pretending there is no war?' I'm not sure I like the new guy.",
    "80BD0275": "Someone must be expecting us. Is anyone here?",
    "80BD0277": "Rasputin?",
    "80BD0279": "Ah, that music... it hurts... just... give me a second... It says",
    "80BD027B": "'Never ask for anything! Never for anything, and especially from those who are stronger than you. They'll make the offer themselves, and give everything themselves.'",
    "80F1EF9A": "I don't understand. Wait. Something's happening ... GAH! Red sand! Mars! Ice caps! Ahhhhh!",
    "80F1EF9C": "Hey! Sorry, I spaced out for a second there. What were we doing?",
    "80BD0281": "So, it turns out, both the music and the quotation predate the Traveler's arrival in this solar system. They're old.",
    "80BD0283": "Maybe we activated some kind of high-tech time capsule.",
    "80BD0285": "Are they scanning that thing, or is it scanning them?",
    "80BD0287": "Hey, Asher? Are you picking up anything strange on channel J-1869? Sounds kind of like music.",
    "80BD0289": "Channel J what? No! No, I hear nothing of consequence on any of my scanners, including this one.",
    "80BD028B": "That's weird. I bet I can track it back to the source.",
    "80BD028D": "They're asleep. The music must have hypnotized them.",
    "80BD0290": "Assistant! I have a task for you, but I fear your fleshy body is... insufficiently resilient for my purposes.",
    "80BD0294": "Did you just say, 'Fleshy?'",
    "80BD0296": "There's a garage nearby, full of armored vehicles. Procure one.",
    "80BD0298": "What kind of information do the Vex want from the Warmind Vault?",
    "80BD029A": "The Warminds had a special connection to humanity's lost arts. Music, literature, film.",
    "80BD029C": "The Vex may not understand this emotional frivolity, but they will use it as a weapon against us. If we let them.",
    "80BD029E": "Now that you have use of this device, do you recall the Warmind Vault?",
    "80BD02A0": "The Vex are keenly interested in its secrets. That ends now.",
    "80BD129A": "We got him, Asher. Looks like the Vex did steal files from the Vault. Let's see Some files about Mars, somebody named Ana Bray",
    "80BD129C": "And, of course, lots of data on the Warmind Project. Hmm. You'll have to take a look. I hope it's useful.",
    "80BD129E": "Hope is a logical fallacy. Only data leads to concrete solutions.",
    "80BD12A0": "I don't see anything of interest in our kill data so far, Asher. Are you sure these are the right Vex?",
    "80BD12A2": "What do you mean, 'the right Vex?'",
    "80BD12A4": "You know, like. Are these the robots we're looking for?",
    "80BD12A6": "The Vex would not trust Goblins and Hydras with such valuable data. You need to find the Vex Mind responsible for the incursions.",
    "80BD12A8": "You're  really infuriating sometimes. All right. One mind, coming up.",
    "80BD12AA": "We're making good progress. Um, I have a suggestion, though.",
    "80BD12AC": "A suggestion?",
    "80BD12AE": "Well, if the Vex stole irreplaceable data, wouldn't it be good to, you know, recover some of it? Instead of destroying it.",
    "80BD12B0": "Hmph. Recover it! Hmph! Yes! Yes. Well! Fine! Fine, do as you see fit!",
    "80BD02BD": "I'm sending that data back now, Asher. Um. Should we keep punching, or—?",
    "80BD02C1": "No! My field equipment is ready. Go to the test site. ",
    "80BD02C3": "If this works, it will change everything.",
    "80BD02C5": "All clear at the test site. Um, you guys have any results? Heh, this thing isn't gonna put the Traveler out of a job, right?",
    "80BD02C7": "Unfortunately, my predictions appear to be flawed. Your Light cannot pass to another. Nor can the 'power' created by this experiment.",
    "80BD02C9": "Asher's learned the same lesson that Ghaul did. We cannot create or take Light. Only the Traveler can choose to gift us with it.",
    "80BD02CB": "What he means is, 'No.' We cannot create or take Light. Only the Traveler can choose to gift us with it.",
    "80BD02CD": "Let us know if we can help with anything else. I didn't think it would work either, but... You can't help hoping for a miracle.",
    "80BD02CF": "Field team to home team. We are 100% irradiated.",
    "80BD02D1": "Excellent. Now, we'll need calibrations. Act naturally, assistant. Go punch something.",
    "80BD02D3": "Think we're coming up on your test site, Asher.",
    "80BD02D5": "You simply need to activate the field equipment to begin. And be gentle with it! It's yours to replace if it breaks!",
    "80BD02D7": "Okay, Asher, something's definitely happening, but we've got a lot of Taken coming in.",
    "80BD02D9": "Yes, yes. I expected they would be drawn by the antiumbral pulses.",
    "80BD02DB": "I have planned a novel experiment, assistant, and you shall be my guinea pig. I need you to gather radiation. Move. Go. Shoo.",
    "80BD02DD": "We're happy to help, but why? What's the experiment?",
    "80BD02DF": "I am trying to create synthetic Light! If this experiment succeeds, then perhaps we can make new Guardians here. ",
    "80BD02E1": "It won't work, Asher. The energy here is not Light, and science cannot manufacture blessings.",
    "80BD02E3": "So you say, but you have not stopped me, have you? You want this to work! And it will! My theory is sound!",
    "80BD02E5": "It's creating some kind of energy. Huh.",
    "80BD02E7": "Extravagant lightshows can't create Guardians.",
    "80BD02E9": "I'm seeing extreme variance in my data. The Taken must not be allowed to interfere with this experiment!",
    "80BD02EC": "Asher. Ikora. The warp gate's toast. We stopped most of the Taken, but a few got through.",
    "80BD02F0": "That's fine. This could have been the beginning of a major war, and you stopped it dead in its tracks.",
    "80BD02F2": "If the Taken and Vex continue to conspire together, I will be the first to know, and you two will be the next.",
    "80BD02F4": "Ahem! I have something to say to you, Guardian, and, if you would, I'd like to say it in person.",
    "80BD02F6": "Are you finally going to thank us? Sure, we're on our way.",
    "80BD02F8": "We have a good view of the Pyramidion. I can see Taken in the distance, just inside the construct.",
    "80BD02FA": "You know first-hand how close Oryx's forces came to capturing the Vex Collective. Imagine the devastation the Taken would wreak if they tried again and succeeded.",
    "80BD02FC": "Oryx, the king who created the Taken, once almost captured the Vex Collective. Imagine the devastation the Taken would wreak if they tried again and succeeded.",
    "80BD02FE": "And imagine the devastation your Resistance would feel, Ikora, when you lose your war hero to the infinite of the Pyramidion. Assistant. Do not venture deeper than you must.",
    "80BD0300": "Of course we're at the top of an impossible cliff. Why would it be anything else?",
    "80BD0302": "Assistant?  Don't die.",
    "80BD0305": "This is just like that base on Phobos. The Taken must be using these rifts to abduct the Vex.",
    "80BD0309": "It's some kind of dimensional rift. The Taken must have used these to abduct the Vex.",
    "80BD030B": "Ikora, we found holding cells, I think. Like a prison for Vex.",
    "80BD030D": "Perhaps the Taken have invented law and order.",
    "80BD030F": "Asher! Save your wit for later. Be mindful, Guardian. I have only one of you.",
    "80BD0311": "We're just outside a Cabal base. Lots of Taken here. Any news from your agents, Ikora?",
    "80BD0313": "I'm afraid the Hidden have not been able to penetrate that base.",
    "80BD0315": "I retract my earlier hypothesis. Something is happening to the Vex. They can all feel it. *I* can feel it; I can feel something grasping at my arm to rip my very essence out of my body. End this, Guardian!",
    "80BD0317": "Ikora, you were right. The Taken are transforming the Vex.",
    "80BD0319": "I knew it! ",
    "80BD031B": "But that's suicidal. Why?",
    "80BD031D": "Well, our guy got away again. Asher, what was it you just said? That it's suicidal for the Taken to turn the Vex into scary void robots?",
    "80BD031F": "Completely suicidal! The Vex infect whatever they touch. Their self-replication subroutines would consume the Taken from the inside out. Perhaps they simply don't realize the dangers.",
    "80BD0321": "Or perhaps they do, and it's a calculated risk.",
    "80BD0323": "To what end?",
    "80BD0325": "They're building an army. That has to be it.  Hurry, Guardian. Meet with Asher. We'll try to understand more of this while you're on your way.",
    "80BD0328": "Ikora, I think we found the Taken Knight behind all of this. He got away, but we're tracking him now.",
    "80BD032C": "That creature had the sense to retreat? Strange. Mind your step.",
    "80BD032E": "We believed only Oryx, the Taken King, had the power to take his enemies and transform them. I fear we may have been wrong.",
    "80BD0330": "I'm with Ikora. Something strange is going on here, and the Taken do not want us around.",
    "80BD0332": "Hey guys? Seems like the Taken are trapping the Vex.",
    "80BD0334": "Why trap them? Are they trying to take them?",
    "80BD0336": "Ikora, please. Without their King, the Taken could not hope to possess even the most dim-witted of Goblins.",
    "80BD0338": "Challenge your assumptions, Asher Mir! It's always the impossible that actually happens.",
    "80BD033A": "Guardian, if you're not busy, I could use your help. As you know, I have a wide network of informants. The Hidden.",
    "80BD033C": "One of my agents saw the Taken interacting strangely with the Vex, and then she went dark.",
    "80BD033E": "Think there's any connection to that Ascendant Portal we destroyed?",
    "80BD0340": "Oh, absolutely. I find you often meet fate on the path you take to avoid it.",
    "80BD0342": "Sorry to hear that. We'll take a look around. Maybe it's nothing",
    "80BD0344": "I'm picking up on a Vex broadcast. Seems like a distress call. We can track it.",
    "80BD0361": "Ahh. How's the scan going?",
    "80BD0365": "Poorly. The Almighty is inextricably bound to the harmonic resonance of the sun's magnetic flux tubes.",
    "80BD0367": "What?",
    "80BD0369": "If Zavala blows up the Almighty, it'll take the sun with it.",
    "80BD036B": "He needs to know this right now.",
    "80BD036D": "As we all know, Zavala plans to attack the Almighty.",
    "80BD036F": "Typical Titan idiocy. I'm sure he thought, 'Ah, Ghaul has a sun-destroyer? I don't need a plan! I'll simply headbutt it!'",
    "80BD0371": "It’s not idiocy, Asher. It's desperation. Arrogance. Zavala has forgotten he might die.",
    "80BD0373": "Head toward the heart of the energy mining operation, Guardian.",
    "80BD0375": "We'll use a Warmind, part of an interplanetary defense network, to scan the Almighty.",
    "80BD0377": "I think we're close, but so are the Taken. Vex, too.",
    "80BD0379": "Pay them no heed, assistant. You and I can deal with them later.",
    "80BD037B": "Ikora, we found another drill. This one's big. Really big.",
    "80BD037D": "Good. That drill pierced an entrance to the Warmind Vault. The scanner's inside.",
    "80BD037F": "Gotcha. Let's find the drill controls and get it out of the way.",
    "80BD0381": "Ha—finally! Let’s find that Warmind.",
    "80BD0383": "I find it incredible that those myopic Red Legion ignorami did not realize they were drilling directly into a Warmind vault.",
    "80BD0385": "Stranger things happen every day.",
    "80BD0387": "We've got the power going, but the drill is still in our way.",
    "80BD0389": "Ha! What a gloriously irritating commitment to safety standards.",
    "80BD038B": "There has to be a manual override somewhere in that base.",
    "80BD038D": "Whoa. The drill's on.",
    "80BD038F": "What? Lift it up, before it collapses the Warmind Vault!",
    "80BD0391": "These are lift controls for the drill! But they're locked. We'll need to override them.",
    "80BD0393": "So, uh Are we going to see Rasputin? Or is this some other Warmind?",
    "80BD0395": "There is only one Warmind, but Rasputin is not here on Io. I believe he's been marooned on Earth ever since his network fragmented.",
    "80BD0397": "So What's a Warmind, exactly?",
    "80BD0399": "It's a kind of artificial intelligence designed to defend humanity against the unknown.",
    "80BD039B": "I'm detecting a spike in paracausal energy. Sterile neutrino particles have quintupled.",
    "80BD039D": "He means watch out for the Taken. You should hire a translator, Asher.",
    "80BD03A1": "I think we've got the drill going.",
    "80BD03A3": "Good. Return to the drill site and get into the Warmind Vault. I am eager to discredit Vuvuzela's plan to attack the Almighty.",
    "80BD03A5": "Hang on, we've got Taken.",
    "80BD03A7": "Reconnecting to the Warmind Network to begin a remote scan",
    "80BD03A9": "Yes, we can see the connection coming online.",
    "80BD03AB": "This will be rich. I will ask Zavala, 'Can you tell me, in zettajoules, the Almighty's expected destructive capacity?'",
    "80BD03AD": "And he will say, 'No, Asher, I cannot, because I am a reckless fool!'",
    "80BD03AF": "Ignore Asher. Find the Warmind, reconnect it to the Network, and we'll handle the rest.",
    "80BD03B1": "Asher, Ikora, we're on our way into the Vault.",
    "80BD03BB": "Nice work. Let's find that override.",
    "80BD03FA": "Look at the sky! What is that, Ikora?",
    "80BD03FE": "Energy... The Traveler's energy! What have they done?!",
    "80BD0400": "This is my fault. I could have stopped this.",
    "80BD0402": "Ikora, there's no way! Not without your Light.",
    "80BD0404": "I am more than just my Light! I could have tried! I should have tried.",
    "80BD0406": "But After all these years dying, being reborn, dying again The Traveler has left me with one life, and I am afraid to lose it.",
    "80BD0408": "That might happen anyway. Ghaul has a weapon that can blow up our sun.",
    "80BD040A": "What? Why would he destroy what he’s worked so hard to conquer? Get into that base; there must be answers there.",
    "80BD040C": "Red Legion ships have been in and out non-stop since I got here. We need to know what they’re doing. Get into that base.",
    "80BD040E": "Why are the Taken here? They have no leader; Oryx is dead.",
    "80BD0410": "The Taken will always be drawn to the Traveler’s energy. They are no longer Fallen or Hive or Cabal. ",
    "80BD0412": "Oryx changed them with the dark powers he stole. He --",
    "80BD0414": "Wait. Is Ghaul’s plan to do the same -- but with the Light...?",
    "80BD0416": "What were those things?",
    "80BD0418": "The Taken. A mindless army of stolen souls. They will forever be drawn to the Traveler’s energy. ",
    "80BD12B5": "They are no longer Fallen or Cabal. A Hive god changed them with the dark powers he stole. He -- ",
    "80BD12B7": "Wait. Is Ghaul’s plan to do the same -- but with the Light...?",
    "80BD12B9": "That has to be it!",
    "80BD041E": "Looks like the Taken are conjuring some kind of portal.",
    "80BD0420": "Stop them! Doubtless, those mindless vermin intend to summon every last one of their spectral friends to devour this moon.",
    "80BD0422": "We're coming up on a big drill.",
    "80BD0424": "A drill? Are they MINING the Traveler’s energy?",
    "80BD0426": "No! It’s NOT Light. It can’t GIVE the Traveler’s blessing. Not to me, not to Ghaul --",
    "80BD0428": "Or could it?",
    "80BD042A": "All channels! This is a skyshock alert! Someone or something drew the Taken here!",
    "80BD042C": "Asher Mir? Is that you?",
    "80BD042E": "Irrelevant! The Taken are sapping the moon's energy. I hypothesize that Io will implode if someone does not intervene!",
    "80BD0430": "Guardian -- we can not lose this sacred place. Do what must be done. Stop the Taken.",
    "80BD0432": "Ikora",
    "80BD0434": "What's wrong?",
    "80BD0436": "Taken rifts. Defensive wards, too.",
    "80BD0438": "What do you see?",
    "80BD043A": "I don't know. Dimensional rifts, some kind of magic",
    "80BD043C": "The Taken! ",
    "80BD12BB": "Ghaul must be mining the Traveler’s remnant energy in the hopes of transforming himself and the Red Legion into wielders of the Light. ",
    "80BD12BD": "If he succeeds ...he will become immortal. Unstoppable.",
    "80BD1305": "We have to tell Zavala. Meet me outside. ",
    "80BD0446": "Portal's closed. We're clear. Ikora, I know this place is important to you, but",
    "80BD0448": "There is nothing for me here on Io. I have one life left to give, and I will give it gladly to stop Ghaul. We leave now.",
    "80BD044A": "Don't be so hasty. Ikora Rey, we must talk. And as for you, meddling Guardian, I have a few choice things to say to you.",
    "80BD044C": "We definitely didn't close it.",
    "80BD044E": "Ahh! Remedy this mess, you fools!",
    "80BD0450": "There it goes. Looks like we closed the portal.",
    "80BD0452": "Then why am I still seeing abnormal neutrino scattering?",
    "80BD0454": "Hang on. We're gonna take a closer look.",
    "80BD0456": "Io.... The whole place hums with energy left behind by the Traveler’s unfinished work.  ",
    "80BD0458": "No wonder Guardians consider this site sacred. ",
    "80BD045A": "Now that Cayde is back in the fold, all we need is to find Ikora, make the Vanguard whole again....",
    "80BD045C": "...and bring down the Almighty.",
    "80BD045E": "Those tubes are full of energy. ",
    "80BD0460": "Looks like the Legion's packing up, Ikora.",
    "80BD0462": "Find out what they’re shipping. We need every scrap of intel we can get.",
    "80BD0464": "The blue substance oozing from the cracks in the ground: That’s the Traveler’s raw energy. ",
    "80BD0466": "Everyone's gone.",
    "80BD0468": "Keep looking. It’s not like the Cabal to invest so much in a base, and just... abandon it.",
    "80BD130A": "Ah, my able assistant.",
    "80BD130C": "Your presence is disrupting my research.",
    "80BD130E": "I'm supposed to be grateful. So ... ahem.",
    "80BD1310": "You did something to deserve this, I'm sure.",
    "80BD1312": "This is yours. And ... now leave.",
    "80BD1314": "What? Ahh. Err ... Thank you.",
    "80BD1316": "There is an issue you could resolve for me, assistant.",
    "80BD1318": "I believe even your skills are up to the task I have here.",
    "80BD131A": "As long as you're here, I have a problem.",
    "80BD131C": "I have a problem here. You will solve it for me.",
    "80BD131E": "I have an issue. It needs to be resolved. And I am unsuited to do so.",
    "80BD1320": "Assistant, I can see a use for you today. Solve for this, would you?",
    "80BD1322": "I have larger concerns to see to at the moment. See to this task, if you would.",
    "80BD1324": "Ahh, my assistant. I want to introduce you to this little problem I've been having.",
    "80FF5429": "Pathetic old fool. Can't solve the radiolaria origin question even to—quite literally!—save your own damn life.",
    "80FF542A": "Experiment 1008: Radiolarian fluid and exposure to EVEN HIGHER HEAT. TAKE THAT, YOU MISERABLE GOOP!",
    "80FF542B": "I know why I'm still out here. But you, Sloan—what are you still doing on Titan? On some sort of secret mission, are you?",
    "80FF542C": "Ah, just because I am Awoken. I have never been to the Reef, Ser Fen.",
    "80FF542D": "From a certain point of view, my condition is inevitable. I made the decisions I made. And I would make them again, all things being equal.",
    "80FF542F": "Despite how it may seem, I regret what happened to my Ghost. I chose to enter the Pyramidion. He just had my back.",
    "80FF5431": "It doesn't hurt. Not really. My nerve endings have been transformed where they meet the bio-circuitry. None of that matters when I dream, though.",
    "80FF5433": "The Vex are beautiful. The simplicity of even the basest Goblin, their purposeful design. I still admire them. In a way.",
    "80FF5435": "I did not want to come to Io. The crowded nature of Venus and the Cabal stake in Mars left me with little choice. This was a quiet little moon. Until you showed up.",
    "80FF5437": "I, um, really should show my appreciation to Ikora more often. She has been very supportive since the incident. More than she should be, given my disposition.",
    "80FF5439": "Spare me your pity, Guardian. I stand before you, of sound mind and filled with intellectual fury. What is there to pity?",
    "80FF543B": "I have not been reborn since the accident. In truth, I do not know what would happen. Is my Ghost even capable of such a thing anymore?",
    "80FF543D": "I have considered ending my Ghost. None of my research indicates a way to extricate the Vex technology from its shell. This is how I know I am a coward. Because I cannot bring myself to—",
    "80FF543F": "After the accident, my fireteam tried to help. But everything they did reminded me of that day. I wonder I wonder if they survived the attack on the City?",
    "80FF5441": "It is remarkable how a ticking clock can focus your vision. Redefine what is and is not important.",
    "80FF5443": "Dead Orbit's philosophy is the one true way. I'm convinced, now. Our future lies beyond these stars somewhere.",
    "80FF5445": "What? What do you want? Why are you looking at me like that? I work alone. ",
    "80FF5446": "Allow me to preempt you. I have no interest in being your Crimson Double.",
    "80FF5447": "I will admit that I feel an immense and dreadful gratitude that I am still alive this Dawning.",
    "80FF5448": "I will say this once, and once alone: Though I may not often say so, I take great courage from your visits, Assistant. Here's to a Happy Dawning.",
    "80FF5449": "As if I weren't already hopelessly behind on my correspondence. I'll respond as quickly as I can, Ser Fen. ",
    "80FF544A": "No, Petra, I'm afraid I don't have any additional information for you, but I will look over the Warmind's latest analysis.",
    "80FF544B": "I always suspected that Mara survived the Battle of Saturn. She's far too wily to just die at the hands of some Hive king.",
    "80FF544C": "So I outlived another one, eh? Wouldn't have thought it. ",
    "80FF544D": "This is your first time losing a Hunter Vanguard, is it? It's my fifth. No, sixth. My, they go fast. Of course, they didn't all die. Most, but not all. ",
    "80FF544E": "Listen here. I perceive you and Cayde were close. So [clears throat] if you need a moment please go grieve somewhere I can't see you.",
    "80FF544F": "It strikes me, not for the first time, that Guardians are uniquely ill-equipped for grief. We spend so much of our formative years thinking ourselves impervious to it. But well, look at us. ",
    "80FF5450": "My condition has spread to my lungs. I fear my heart is next.",
    "80FF5451": "Osiris is wasting his time in the Infinite Forest. Larking around in a simulation doing theoretical research is nothing compared to field research.",
    "80BD04DB": "What could you possibly want?",
    "80F1EFDC": "Do not test my patience.",
    "80F1EFDE": "Speak or move on.",
    "80F1EFE0": "I am annoyed. And I am armed.",
    "80F1EFE2": "The suspense is killing me. Oh wait, that's the Vex.",
    "80F1EFE3": "Are you under the impression this is a companionable silence? ",
    "80FF5452": "You're right, if you look very closely, you can actually see the conversion process.",
    "80F1EFE5": "Did Ikora send you? Tell her I'm still two manuscripts behind. She writes too fast!",
    "80F1EFE6": "I can't afford to let death slow my research. Not even my own, if I can help it. ",
    "80F1EFE7": "Despite everything, we've made it through another year. Happy Dawning to you.",
    "80F1EFE8": "I wonder if this Dawning will be my last",
    "80F1EFE9": "Partnerships are overrated. Do not hesitate to revel in solitude these Crimson Days, Guardian.",
    "80F1EFEA": "Crimson Days, feh. What a worthless celebration.",
    "80F1EFEB": "You look almost as miserable as me. ",
    "80F1EFEC": "Will you look this sad at my funeral, I wonder? It's a pleasant fantasy.",
    "80F1EFED": "Come now, there are dozens of Hunters out there just like Cayde. You'll find another insufferable fool in short order.",
    "80FF5453": "Any word from the Reef? Professional curiosity only, of course. ",
    "80FF5454": "Uldren Sov was a conniving wretch. Nothing like his sister. I'm glad he died.",
    "80FF5455": "Are you satisfied by your quest for vengeance?",
    "80F1EFF2": "Walk away from the Dreaming City. It's a lost cause.",
    "80F1EFF3": "I hear you've been waxing quixotic. Why do you throw yourself at the curse on the Dreaming City?",
    "80F1EFF4": "Have you seen anything in the Dreaming City that might help my condition?",
    "80F1EFF5": "Unsurprising that the Reef Awoken kept Ahamkara. I've heard far more salacious allegations leveled against them.",
    "80FF5456": "These calculations would astonish even the most hardened of Cryptarchs.",
    "80FF5458": "Ever-spiralling complexity. Their simulations are potentially limitless.",
    "80FF545A": "Every iteration of the Collective nets me more data. I need more information!",
    "80FF545C": "You're imagining it. You cannot feel the nanomachines in your tendons. It's just your mind playing tricks on you.",
    "80FF545E": "Experiment 922: Planning. Radiolarian fluid and exposure to high heat. ",
    "80FF5460": "I see your point, Sloane, but I fail to see how Resistance problems on Titan impact me out here.",
    "80FF5462": "You are seriously telling me you have access to a Golden Age AI, and you're letting it just sit there? What's wrong with you?",
    "80FF5464": "I'm so close. If I can just (weird vex noises). Argh!",
    "80FF5466": "Perhaps if I just— No! I will not suffer ambiguity with this work.",
    "80FF5468": "I understand, Arach. I'm willing to pass along my data if you think it will free us from this graveyard of a system.",
    "80FF546A": "This is why I work alone. ",
    "80FF546C": "I am not a museum specimen.",
    "80FF546E": "It's hard to calculate with you just standing there.",
    "80FF5470": "Eh-eh-ehm!",
    "80FF5472": "If you are staring at my arm, leave. Now.",
    "80FF5474": "Are we having a moment?",
    "80BD050F": "Guardian.",
    "80BD0511": "Yes?",
    "80BD0513": "What?",
    "80BD0515": "Do you need something?",
    "80BD0517": "Let's be quick.",
    "80BD0519": "Hmm?",
    "80BD051B": "Science waits for no one.",
    "80BD051D": "Ah. Hello.",
    "80BD051F": "What are you into now?",
    "80BD0521": "Is there something you need?",
    "80BD0523": "I'm ready.",
    "80BD0525": "Speak, assistant.",

    "80BD052D": "Make it quick.",
    "80BD052F": "What now?",
    "80BD0531": "I have little time and less patience.",
    "80BD0533": "Ugh. Another interruption.",
    "80FF5476": "If only I had more time",
    "80FF5478": "Juice box. (snorts derisively)",
    "80FF547A": "(weird vex noises) I don't see how that's relevant.",
    "80FF547C": "If my calculations are correct (weird vex noises). Quiet, you.",
    "80FF547E": "And so once again I must endure the torture of collaborative science.",
    "80FF5480": "Dead Orbit had the right of it. This system is doomed.",
    "80FF5482": "I admire your lust for vengeance.",
    "80FF5483": "That mess with Cayde is simply a reminder that we all have an expiration date.",

    "80BD133C": "Oh look. You brought me something. Hmph.",
    "80BD133E": "What am I supposed to do with this?",
    "80BD1340": "This is ... fine.",
    "80BD1342": "Ahh. I see. I'll add it to the others.",
    "80BD1344": "I will find room for this in my studies.",

    "80BD134A": "If you must.",
    "80BD134C": "That will have to do.",
    "80BD134E": "The purchase will suffice, I hope.",
    "80BD1350": "The price is right, I suppose.",
    "80BD1352": "Yes, yes. Take it and go.",
    "80BD1354": "Not what I would have chosen, but",
    "80BD135C": "If it suits you.",
    "80BD1392": "Hopefully more reliable than my calculations would suggest.",
    "80BD1396": "Interesting. To each their own, I suppose.",
    "80BD1398": "You live more dangerously than I care to, Guardian.",
    "80BD139A": "Hmm. Interesting energy patterns in that one.",
    "80BD139C": "By my calculations, that should serve you well.",
    "80BD139E": "I suppose if you're going to buy anything, that's the one to buy.",
    "80BD13A0": "Oh. Well, that certainly may have its uses.",
    "80BD13A2": "Usage data from this purchase would be of great interest to me, Guardian.",
    "80BD13A4": "Yes, yes. Go.",
    "80BD13A6": "Don't die.",
    "80BD13A8": "Hold to the Light.",

    "80BD13AE": "Yes, go. Quickly, Hunter.",
    "80BD13B0": "Don't you have some treasure to hunt?",
    "80BD13B3": "Try not to fall over, Titan.",

    "80BD13C1": "Asher, guess what we did!",
    "80BD13C3": "Caused pandemonium among the Cabal? Detonated vehicles? Pulverized a Commander?",
    "80BD05D5": "Yes! How'd you know?",
    "80BD13C6": "From the unbearable racket! My... head!",
    "80BD13C8": "What's with all this crashing about, eh?",
    "80BD13CA": "We shot down a ship! And a Commander! And we hijacked the lander!",
    "80BD13CC": "That is adequately impressive. You have exceeded my expectations.",
    "80BD13CE": "They incinerated the lander again. Figures.",
    "80BD13D0": "Had I been there, the lander would have been captured properly! That is the difference between adequate and proficient!",
    "80BD1514": "Asher, they blew it up.",
    "80BD1516": "Incinerating it before it could fall into your hands? The Cabal must be terrified of you. I don't see why.",
    "80BD1518": "If you must go crashing about, first find me. Otherwise you'll interfere with my delicate experiments.",
    "80BD05E9": "I… don't have a lander. ",
    "80BD05EB": "Ooh, I got a lander!",
    "80BD151B": "That's one more ship they won't see again.",
    "80BD1526": "We knocked that ship out of the sky!",
    "80BD152A": "Cabal, again? With that blasted, rock-shaking, concentration-shattering machinery!",
    "80BD152E": "Those nattering, insolent Cabal! What are they up to now, eh?",
    "80BD1530": "Ha, the big guy ran away! So much for their mining expedition!",
    "80BD1532": "Hmph. That is... almost acceptable.",
    "80BD1534": "That big guy's gonna wake up hurting tomorrow.",
    "80BD1536": "Who cares about him? My... head! Enh? Not any more? Ah, it's quiet again Good.",
    "80BD1538": "Got them on the run again!",
    "80BD153A": "I expected nothing less. And nothing more.",
    "80BD153C": "That's right, take your lander and run!",
    "80BD153E": "I do not think the Cabal run so much as leap. Strive for precision, assistant!",
    "80BD1540": "What a nice lander, sitting all alone out here Let's take it.",
    "80BD1542": "As long as you can take it far, far away from me.",
    "80BD1544": "Let's capture this lander!",
    "80BD1546": "Capture, destroy—Either way, get it out of here!",
    "80BD1551": "My instruments tell me the Vex have come and gone unhampered. Go back to whatever you were doing.",
    "80BD1553": "They're gone.",
    "80BD1555": "They may have completed this part of their project, but if my data can be trusted, these horrible creatures have planned more.",
    "80BD1557": "The Vex are marching to integrate, Guardian. You know what must be done.",
    "80BD1559": "If anyone is listening, I require assistance. A wrenching in my arm Ugh, The Vex are active somewhere.",
    "80BD155B": "I do so love the sound of a spire falling.",
    "80BD155D": "As I anticipated from prior data, your abilities were exactly suited to the task. Another hypothesis proven correct. Hmph.",
    "80BD155F": "Whatever they were trying to build, we wrecked it!",
    "80BD1561": "I almost feel No, no, that's impossible. An adequate performance!",
    "80BD1563": "You may have promise, stranger. If you find the right tutor. Mmm, hmmm",
    "80BD1565": "Do you hear that, Asher? Another spire falls!",
    "80BD1567": "Much as it pains me to say it, I predicted you would succeed. Take my thanks and never speak of it again.",
    "80BD1569": "We blew that spire to bits!",
    "80BD156B": "I must admit, you have impressed me today. And I am rarely impressed.",
    "80BD156D": "We thinned them out! That'll hurt!",
    "80BD156F": "Hmph. I have seen what you can do. They'll be back soon enough.",
    "80BD1571": "We knocked down a bunch of them!",
    "80BD1573": "For now, that will have to be enough. Hmph. At least those clacking distractions are gone.",
    "80BD1575": "Oh, Asher... Guess what we just did...",
    "80BD1577": "Your insufferable Ghost expects me to say, 'Well done.' As if you didn't already know.",
    "80BD1579": "What is the meaning of this stillness?",
    "80BD157B": "We've got the Vex on the run!",
    "80BD157D": "Hmm. They will not forget what you've done. The Vex have long memories.",
    "80BD157F": "There go the Vex, extending their substructure again.",
    "80BD1581": "They must be stopped.",
    "80BD1583": "These Vex... They're marching with purpose.",
    "80BD1585": "They've engaged protocols for integration. I can feel it.",
    "80BD1587": "Oh, are these your plates? So sorry. Really.",
    "80BD1589": "I think we made them angry! Ha!",
    "80BD158B": "Your lackluster attitude reminds me of Hneh. I can concentrate again, that's all that matters.",
    "80BD158D": "Hneh. The problem's gone. Never mind.",
    "80BD158F": "And stay away! None of your drinking subsurface energy around here!",
    "80BD1591": "Hmm. One success is a deviation. Multiple successes over time that bears further study.",
    "80BD1593": "Take that Taken!",
    "80BD1595": "Have you sealed the interdimensional breach? Excellent. Then let us both resume our tasks.",
    "80BD1597": "Yeah, run back to your alternate dimension! Go on! Shoo!",
    "80BD1599": "For the last time, that is not how any of this works. I must admit that your methods get results. Continue.",
    "80BD159B": "That's right, run away, you big interdimensional chicken!",
    "80BD159D": "Who are you calling a barnfowl? Ah. You mean the Taken. Carry on.",
    "80BD159F": "I don't know who you are, but you have somehow failed to foul things up. Ehn. Hmmm.",
    "80BD15A1": "Another day, another Taken champion defeated. Go on. Congratulate us.",
    "80BD15B5": "I will spare you the horror of vague and repetitive praise. It does terrible things to the mind. But hmph Thank you.",
    "80BD15B7": "Ha! That's what you get for trying to rip open the fabric of reality!",
    "80BD15B9": "Your grasp of relativity is execrable. Nevertheless, you've let me return to my studies. Thank you.",
    "80BD15BB": "That horrible interference again! I trust you remember what to do.",
    "80BD15BD": "Ehh... The Taken disturb my focus. Some transdimensional nonsense.",
    "80BD15BF": "Let's make these Taken pay!",
    "80BD15C1": "Yes! Good! Increase the factor of deterrence!",
    "80BD15C3": "These Taken are drinking something from the ground!",
    "80BD15C5": "I don't care who's drinking what! Hurry up and deal with them.",
    "80BD15C7": "Watch that Blight! Here it comes!",
    "80BD15C9": "That Blight—it's opening!",
    "80BD15CB": "That's right, move along!",
    "80BD15CD": "My assistant, a herder of Taken. Hneh. Better you than me.",
    "80BD15D3": "Ah, my focus has returned. Good. That'll be all.",
    "80BD15D5": "You're very welcome!",
    "80BD067D": "Odd. We're monitoring the Pyramidion's resonant frequencies as you explore. I thought I recognized the voice of Osiris? No",
    "80BD0681": "You should now be arriving on the shores of an inscrutable radiolarian lake.",
    "80BD0682": "Oh. Not a pit?",
    "80BD0683": "What pit? There is no pit in the Pyramidion!",
    "80BD0684": "Uh, I mean yes! Silly me! Here's the lake now.",
    "80BD0685": "We went through a gate! Now we're looking at a scary bottomless pit.",
    "80BD0686": "What? There is no pit! Only the fractal shores of a radiolarian lake!",
    "80BD0687": "This is nothing like Asher's stories of the Pyramidion. This is clearly some kind of trap.",
    "80BD0688": "According to my projections, you should now be approaching the lake of radiolarian fluid where I was afflicted.",
    "80BD0689": "Mmm... Nope. No lake. Just an ominous pit.",
    "80BD068A": "Fireteam Intrepid is boots-on-the-ground outside the Pyramidion. I understand that it is a conversion engine?",
    "80BD068B": "Yes. The Vex will use it to transform Io into a machine-world.",
    "80BD068C": "Forget Io. The Genesis Mind defeated my fireteam and corrupted my arm. Destroy it. I want to hear its screams from here.",
    "80BD068D": "Fireteam Intrepid, you're a go for field ops. I'm handing you off to Asher Mir and Ikora Rey for briefing and mission support.",
    "80BD068E": "This is about simple vengeance, assistant. Brakion, the Genesis Mind, converted my arm and changed my life forever. I want it dead.",
    "80BD068F": "Fireteam Intrepid just landed. This is a hit operation on a priority target. Who are they looking for, Ikora?",
    "80BD0690": "Brakion, the Genesis Mind. It controls the Pyramidion, the conversion engine consuming this moon.",
    "80BD0691": "We must not allow the Vex to corrupt this sacred place as they corrupted Asher Mir.",
    "80BD0692": "Ooo! Oh, I know I can fix you, but...",
    "80BD0693": "Oh, that probably smells. I'm glad I don't have a nose.",
    "80BD0694": "Agh! Should've warned you, sorry.",
    "80BD0695": "Watch out! ... Oh.",
    "80BD0696": "Wow, these lasers are really effective.",
    "80BD0697": "It's good that the Vex don't understand resurrection, or they'd calibrate their lasers to target me instead of you.",
    "80BD0698": "Incineration... Ugh. Why couldn't it be something easy to fix, like decapitation?",
    "80BD0699": "Ohh, that's gotta hertz. Sorry, sorry...",
    "80BD069A": "Whoa, that one really toasted you, didn't it?",
    "80BD069B": "Occam's Laser: The right path is the one with the fewest lasers...",
    "80BD069C": "Hanlon's Laser: Never attribute to lasers that which is adequately explained by stupidity.",
    "80BD069D": "Watch out! Oh. It got you. Sorry.",
    "80BD069E": "Eesh, that's... That's not pretty...",
    "80BD069F": "Ooh, you went right into it, didn't you.",
    "80BD06A0": "You know, if these lasers weren't so deadly, I'd suggest we use them to secure Resistance assets.",
    "80BD06A1": "Let's not tell Shaxx about these lasers. He'd put them into every single Crucible arena.",
    "80BD06A2": "Oof. These things are brutal.",
    "80BD06A3": "Aaaand there you go. Disintegrated.",
    "80BD06A4": "I wonder why the Vex settled on lasers instead of... Oh, I don't know. Sharpened pendulums. Giant boulders.",
    "80BD06A5": "Ikora, you were right about the Taken in here.",
    "80BD06A6": "I expected as much. Don't let them distract you from finding the Genesis Mind. We'll deal with them another time.",
    "80BD06A7": "Oh, good. Taken ninjaing out of thin air. Just what we needed.",
    "80BD06A8": "Hey, team, there are Taken here. ... Team?",
    "80BD06A9": "That's fine. We're only inside of a giant, planet-transforming pyramid with interdimensional specters and reality-bending robots. What could go wrong?",
    "80BD06AA": "Brakion, Genesis Mind, is no more.",
    "80BD06AB": "Bring me its arm. I wish to hang it in a place of honor. If it's been destroyed, bring me the ashes. I have constructed an urn for them.",
    "80BD06AD": "Well?! Did you find Brakion? Did you sever its arm from its chassis and send it spiraling into the infinite?",
    "80BD06AE": "Haha, ah... It's dead. It's—it's real dead.",
    "80BD06B0": "Tell me! Is the Genesis Mind dead yet?",
    "80BD06B1": "Yep. Went down like a ton of bricks.",
    "80BD06B2": "Yes... I have dreamt of revenge since I woke in the hospital without my arm.",
    "80BD06B8": "Fireteam Intrepid is live. I'm handing you off to Asher Mir and Ikora Rey for briefing. Good luck.",
    "80BD06B9": "You seek Brakion, the Genesis Mind. It is programmed to transform every speck of matter on this moon into a machine.",
    "80BD06BA": "And be mindful. Some Taken were likely stranded in the Pyramidion when you destroyed that warp gate.",
    "80BD06BB": "Keep an eye out. My agents have reported sightings of Taken infiltrating the Pyramidion.",
    "80BD06BC": "Brakion, the Genesis Mind, commands the conversion protocol here on Io. You'll have to go deep into the Pyramidion to find the Mind.",
    "80BD06BD": "And when you destroy it Rip its arm off for me. Make it even.",
    "80BD06BE": "Asher's not the only one with a score to settle. Some Taken forces may still be inside the Pyramidion, searching for a way out.",
    "80BD06BF": "I have reason to believe there may be a Taken presence inside the Pyramidion. Watch your back when you get inside.",
    "80BD06C0": "Operation Intrepid is live on Io. Ikora Rey and Asher Mir standing by, based on this team's collective experience with the Pyramidion.",
    "80BD06C1": "Activating Operation Intrepid on Io. Asher Mir and Ikora Rey standing by. We're sending you into the Pyramidion.",
    "80BD06C2": "Delve into its very core to find Brakion, the Vex Mind that transformed my arm. It's your duty to exact vengeance on my behalf.",
    "80BD06C3": "We always get the low pressure gigs...",
    "80BD06C4": "The Vex are single-minded and predictable. But the Taken? They represent entropy. Unpredictable, unsimulatable entropy.",
    "80BD06C5": "When the King fell, the Taken became aimless. Now, they move with renewed purpose. We have no time for another war.",
    "80BD06C6": "The Taken and the Vex are alike in more ways than not. Both races are designed to serve a single, higher power.",
    "80BD06C7": "Missions like these make me miss Eris Morn's wisdom. I imagine you'll meet her someday, when she returns from her business with the Hive.",
    "80BD06C8": "I wish Eris had not left us. She would have theories about what the Taken want with the Vex.",
    "80BD06D2": "Ahem! You should now find yourself staring into the inscrutable nostril of a slumbering machine. Proceed inside.",
    "80BD06D3": "Sorry, a nostril? You're sure about that?",
    "80BD06D4": "You suggest I would say anything I am not certain of?",
    "80BD06D5": "You should now find yourself before an abyss of swirling data. Various realities being written and overwritten, you see",
    "80BD06D6": "Uh... I really want to tell you that's exactly what we're looking at, but...",
    "80BD06D7": "Asher just stepped away -- he's referencing no fewer than five of his own books on the Pyramidion, and I'm not sure which I can use to guide you.",
    "80BD06D8": "'Existential Tyranny: Part 1'?  Um 'Negation and Identity: Vex Transformation Mechanisms'? Euh... This is why I prefer applied research...",
    "80BD06DD": "We're analyzing live data from your team and... brace yourself, I believe our Gensym Scribe is genuinely confounded.",
    "80BD06DE": "Inaccurate! I have never been confounded in my life.",
    "80BD06DF": "Asher's studying data on your current position. I believe he's said impossible, oh...12 times and counting. Here, I'll patch him in:",
    "80BD06E0": "Impossible! Impossible. But could it? No, no, no, no, that's impossible. Impossible! Why? What could govern such an impossible discrepancy?",
    "80BD06E1": "Asher can't figure out where you are. If he drops out, it's because he's thrown a tantrum and broken his microphone.",
    "80BD06E2": "I heard that, you wretch!",
    "80BD06E3": "Mmm. He feels safe saying such things because *he* is on Io, and *I* am not.",
    "80BD06F0": "So, it's just us and a massive Vex Gate.",
    "80BD06F1": "Ah! The Vex gate at the center of the lake!",
    "80BD06F2": "What lake!",
    "80BD06F3": "The lake where you will grind Brakion's horns into dust and crush its chassis beneath your boot—that lake!",
    "80BD06F4": "My projections show that you've reached the synthoneural terminus at the center of the lake.",
    "80BD06F5": "Maybe the lake is a metaphor?",
    "80BD06F6": "Summon the Genesis Mind. Destroy it. Make it suffer. And it is not a metaphor!",
    "80BD06F7": "We're in some kind of... interdimensional terminal.",
    "80BD06F8": "The synthoneural terminus. You're on Brakion's doorstep.",
    "80BD06F9": "Inform the Genesis Mind that it has guests.",
    "80BD06FA": "This is not the only Pyramidion. I do wonder if each one is an individual manifestation, linked to a common interior space. Just as the Vex are all linked to a common Mind...",
    "80BD06FB": "I have not spoken to my old fireteam since the accident. Nor have they spoken to me. And so, we prove the resilience of comradery.",
    "80BD06FC": "We have never witnessed the origins of the Vex. They are not born, like humans. They are not created, like Exos. Perhaps, like the Awoken and my arm, they are converted.",
    "80BD06FD": "You've never told me about your fireteam, Asher.",
    "80BD06FE": "What is there to say? Hunters, the both of them. I hired them for an earlier expedition and we stuck together. Until we didn't. So.",
    "80BD06FF": "Door's open! Where can we find the Genesis Mind?",
    "80BD0700": "In the self-organized criticality of the synthoneural terminus.",
    "80BD0701": "No one knows what that means, Asher. Just make your way inside.",
    "80BD0702": "So, what can we expect from this place?",
    "80BD0703": "A cascading hellscape of infinite change. My fireteam required dozens of resurrections on our expedition.",
    "80BD0704": "And I'm sure it was uphill both ways to the lake where you lost your arm.",
    "80BD0705": "You waste my time with a vapid joke, but, yes! Paradoxically, it was.",
    "80BD0706": "Door's open! Anything we should know as we go in?",
    "80BD0707": "The Genesis Mind worked tirelessly to block my fireteam's advance on his terminus. He reconfigured reality itself to stop us.",
    "80BD0708": "It would not surprise me in the least if he intends to employ the same strategy with you, assistant.",
    "80BD0709": "Reality seems pretty well configured in here, but we'll keep our eye out.",
    "80BD070A": "Ikora, Asher. We found a way in.",
    "80BD070B": "Keep us appraised of your progress, please. There's no way for us to know if you're busy fighting, or you've transcended this reality.",
    "80BD070D": "Indeed. It's entirely probable that the Vex are simulating our interactions with you at this very moment.",
    "80BD070E": "The Taken and the Vex share one key ability—the power to infect the very nature of one's existence.  ",
    "80BD070F": "The Taken move between dimensions as effortlessly as the Vex move between realities. Perhaps their mindlessness is the key...",
    "80BD0710": "I'm seeing an unacceptable level of variance in my field instruments. I hypothesize Taken interference. Eliminate them.",
    "80BD0711": "Asher just observed a spike in neutrino scattering. In my experience, those spikes usually mean incoming Taken. Eyes up.",
    "80BD071D": "Taken interference notwithstanding, you should now face an amygdalan causeway. Proceed. Avoid the density matrix.",
    "80BD071E": "You are... certain that you know where they are?",
    "80BD071F": "Nothing is certain in the Pyramidion. My hypotheses are mere approximation.",
    "80BD0720": "You should now be entering a Hilbert space, if the Taken have not misaligned the Pyramidion's base geometric intuitions.",
    "80BD0721": "Gesundheit.",
    "80BD0722": "I did not sneeze, you fool. It is an infinite-dimensional functional space, the Vex often— Oh, why am I wasting my breath!",
    "80BD0723": "If your current eigenstate is comparable to my historical data, I predict you should now find yourself in a vast desert of tiny, cubic crystals.",
    "80BD0724": "Climb straight up the Sierpinski carpet and then through the manifold. Brakion is not far now.",
    "80BD0725": "Uhh... Got it. Do you think Asher's playing some weird... science prank on us?",
    "80BD07BB": "Ascendant Realm readings in spades here. Down the line this could be another one of those weird portals. The Taken are so strange.",
    "80BD07BF": "I'm detecting ... I think this is sending a message back to the Ascendant Realm. But who's listening?",
    "80BD07C1": "Listen. It sounds like... It sounds like someone's whispering in there. Over and over. Eugh.",
    "80BD07C3": "The Vex calibrate their weapons depending on the tactics of their enemies. Not sure where they got the idea about lasers, but... You can't say it's not effective.",
    "80BD07C5": "It's an orrery -- a model of our solar system. I bet someone left this here as a memento of their pilgrimage.",
    "80BD07C7": "This is going to sound like Asher's mumbo-jumbo, but I swear this is real: this thing's emitting x-wave pulses. It shouldn't be able to do that ",
    "80BD07C9": "I'm detecting gigs and gigs of data running along that lightpath. I can't even begin to understand. And look at me! I'm pretty good at this stuff.",
    "80BD07CB": "Even passive, their Gates give off the strangest readings. I'm reading exotic particles from  wow. That is a long, long way from here.",
    "80BD07CD": "I swear I just saw something looking back at us through that thing. The Taken do not live in a nice neighborhood.",
    "80BD07CF": "Looks like Asher might have come through here to do field work. You know, you'd think the City's foremost expert on the Vex would be  neater.",
    "80BD07D1": "I'm taking some background readings here. Past connections include Mercury, Venus, Mars  seems about right. The Vex sure do like to make themselves at home.",
    "80BD07D3": "The Vex transformation process sure leaves some weird artifacts behind. If we let them, they'd have this whole place looking like Nessus, or Mercury!",
    "80BD07D5": "Ikora must have been here at some point. Came up here to meditate about the nature of the Light, and the Traveler. There are so many questions we don't have answered.",
    "80BD07D7": "I wonder whatever happened to that Exo who warned us about the Black Garden? I hope she's okay.",
    "80BD07D9": "I've heard rumors that the Exo were created to fight a war against the Vex. We should ask Cayde if he knows anything about it.",
    "80BD07DB": "I hate these things. I know it's beyond your range of hearing, but they whisper, and whisper...",
    "80BD07DD": "The War against the Taken was hard fought, but at least it never reached the City. Can you imagine these things down in the Wards? Ugh.",
    "80BD07DF": "Must be more stuff Asher left behind. You know, before the accident he used to go out in fireteams? Can you imagine running a strike with him?",
    "80BD07E1": "Looks like this thing used to store files. Someone by the name of Bray scrubbed the data.",
    "80BD07E3": "The Vex never stop, do they? There are as many theories as to why they do what they do as there are cryptarchs in the Cryptarchy.",
    "80BD07E5": "Ikora liked to say the Warminds were our only real link to Earth's history. Life with the Traveler, during the Golden Age. Pre-Collapse.",
    "80BD07E7": "Huh. How strange. This is Vex technology, for sure, but it looks so... primitive. They must have mimicked the design from some time in the far past.",
    "80BD07E9": "I'm detecting a faint connection here to  huh. The Vault of Glass. Remember Kabr? Pahanin. Praedyth ",
    "80BD07EB": "Guardians who make a mark on the Vex become legends. Kabr. Pahanin. Praedyth. Osiris...",
    "80BD07ED": "The Warmind Network used to span across the entire solar system. I guess during the Collapse, it just... fragmented. ",
    "80BD07EF": "Don't touch that thing! It's -- it looks like this access point has been modified to allow Exos to interface with the Vex Network. Let's just. Leave it alone, for now.",
    "80BD07F1": "I'm reading modern encryption here. Someone's been tampering with this access point to allow Exos to interface with the Vex Network.",
    "80BD07F3": "This is sending out some kind of resonant signal. The same syllables, over and over: Sa... Va... Thun...",
    "80BD07F5": "Someone's carved something here... It says, 'O, let Time not deceive you, you cannot conquer Time.' Huh.",
    "80BD07F7": "I read  maybe something from the Cryptarchs? A theory that the Vex are actually that goo in their bellies. The constructs are just exoskeletons that they drive around.",
    "80BD07F9": "Every bit of their tech is part of their conversion process, according to Asher's notes. A whole race dedicated to one thing. But why?",
    "80BD07FB": "I don't think the Taken will go without a leader for long. Someone will try to take control. But when they do... We'll be there to stop them.",
    "80BD07FD": "There's Light radiating from the ruins of that gate. Someone powerful must've made quite the impression on the Vex.",
    "80BD07FF": "Another Taken portal. I  uhh. I'm getting an active scan signal through there. I think something's watching us.",
    "80BD0801": "Do  do you really think the Vex can time travel? If they can time travel, why are we here? Wouldn't they have just  ach, not worth thinking about.",
    "80BD0803": "That blight is emitting ultrasonic resonances, over and over. Sounds like this: Eir. Ur. Yul. Xol. ",
    "80BD0805": "I read once the Traveler is the most studied object in Human history. The people of the Golden Age tracked its movements from planet to planet, trying to understand everything they could.",
    "80BD0807": "I think these blights are like transmitters. They're either calling out to something, or... letting something whisper to the Taken here on Io.",
    "80BD0817": "That explosion triggered some kind of seismic alarm. The Cabal are sending reinforcements.",
    "80BD081B": "Nothing a Warlock can't handle. Remember: targeted destruction.",
    "80BD081D": "We both know they won't be enough, Titan. Keep blowing up that fuel.",
    "80BD081F": "They'll show up just in time for more explosions. Keep it up, Hunter.",
    "80BD0821": "This is a perfect spot. And here they come, just like Sloane said.",
    "80BD0823": "Then put away your weapons and revel in your handiwork!",
    "80BD0825": "Asher, you are a genius.",
    "80BD0827": "Do not waste my time with redundant flatteries! Instead, ruminate on the result of this experiment. Wanton destruction does not equate to victory!",
    "80BD0829": "But it sure does feel good. Great work all around. You too, Asher.",
    "80BD082B": "Hmph!",
    "80BD082D": "Guardian, listen to this. That black oily stuff that runs through Cabal armor? Apparently, it's got multiple functions. Assuming we can trust this intel.",
    "80BD082F": "Do you not trust facts? Hydrostatic organogel affects gravitational throughput for bipeds and vehicles. This is objectively true!",
    "80BD0831": "Wait. That liquid inside Cabal armor is also ship fuel?",
    "80BD0833": "More skepticism. Shoot them in their ridiculous helmets, analyze the results, and see for yourself.",
    "80BD0835": "Asher was right. I've integrated a simple endless loop into the fuel supply. When any device—you stopped listening, didn't you?",
    "80BD0837": "But I am listening! I knew a fellow Warlock would choose correctly.",
    "80BD0839": "But I am listening. And I am in disbelief that a Titan chose to not blow everything up!",
    "80BD083B": "But I am listening! Continue your stealthy work, Hunter. That organogel is no treasure to be pilfered.",
    "80BD083D": "If there is a stockpile inside the ship, then the Cabal are planning something big. You have enough firepower to destroy it all?",
    "80BD083F": "Destroying it is a wasted opportunity! The chemical makeup of the organogel contains pathways for data transmission.",
    "80BD0841": "So you're saying I can hack their body fuel.",
    "80BD0843": "No! well yes! Ugh.",
    "80BD0845": "Don't listen to Asher. Destroy that stuff, Guardian.",
    "80BD0847": "Don't listen to whatever her name is! The answer is sabotage!",
    "80BD0849": "Sounded like some solid precision kills from here. But what was that echo we heard on the last two?",
    "80BD084B": "Local interference. I'm reading a huge cache of that oil stuff inside the Orobas Vectura.",
    "80BD084D": "I cannot believe you abandoned—after I explained—ahhhh!",
    "80BD084F": "I've sabotaged their entire supply.",
    "80BD0851": "And left things remarkably undestroyed. How novel.",
    "80BD0853": "Excellent work, you two. Asher disconnected a while ago, but I was with you the whole way.",
    "80BD0855": "You set the Cabal back weeks with all that destruction. Never had a doubt.",
    "80BD0857": "Those Cabal simpletons will display their ignorance on a grand scale. I cannot wait!",
    "80BD0859": "If I know the Legion, they'll be bringing out the big guns once they realize what you all did.",
    "80BD0680": "You’re not like the others. You chase perfection—not as children chase the sun, but as a hunter stalks prey.",
    "80BD06B4": "Good.",
    "80BD06B6": "You’re not there yet, Guardian. But most extinguish the spark in their chest seeking what you already have: two keys.",
    "80BD06C9": "Continue to seek judgment. Perhaps the final one is within your reach. I pray that it is.",
    "80BD06CB": "For your sake. And theirs.",
    "80BD06CD": "You found it. The third key.",
    "80BD06CF": "It was in front of you all along. On the edge of a blade. At the tip of a bullet. Burning in your Light. ",
    "80BD06D1": "You faced judgment relentless, and now you’re here. At the end of all things.",
    "80BD06DA": "You are worthy. When the time comes, seek us out. Watch for us on the filaments of dark matter. In the hydrocarbon pits of distant moons. ",
    "80BD06DC": "Listen. In the direction of the Corona-Borealis supercluster. Pierce the Lightless void beyond the northern skies and meditate in the hissing silence. ",
    "80BD06E5": "Or do nothing. We are everywhere and nowhere at once.",
    "80BD06E7": "If you don’t see us, you’re not thinking small enough.",
    "80BD06E9": "Now, go home. Safe harbor is very far away.",
    "80BD06EB": "You’re not like the others. You don’t hesitate, as judgment falls upon you like the night.",
    "80BD06ED": "Good.",
    "80BD06EF": "Perhaps you understand. Not like the others, the ones who ask—beg—for mercy.",
    "80BD0713": "Mercy is broken and bleeding. Judgment stands in its place.",
    "80BD0715": "Of all your whispered questions, I will say this: I am no 'Lord Shaxx.' I am judgment. Those I serve have seen to it.",
    "80BD0717": "You’re not like the others. You ride with death. Not away from it.",
    "80BD0719": "Good.",
    "80BD071B": "But what is death to the undying—except, perhaps, a catalyst for change? Do you remember every death, Guardian? I know you’ve forgotten at least one.",
    "80BD0726": "I try not to pity you.",
    "80BD0728": "You wield cosmic power, and you carry the weight of the past around as a shell of armor. You don’t understand. You have nothing.",
    "80BD072A": "No one does.",
    "80BD072C": "Welcome.",
    "80BD085C": "You think you found this place. It wants to be found. There are many like me, and so this place serves myriad purpose.",
    "80BD085F": "One is judgment. In all its connotation. The weight of it as a weapon.",
    "80BD0861": "Another is death. Inevitable. Relentless.",
    "80BD0863": "A third is perfection. Flawless destruction.",
    "80BD0865": "Three keys to unlock irrevocable change.",
    "80BD0867": "Welcome, Guardian to the place where everything dies. And begins anew.",
    "80BD1B36": "That's our ticket out of here. But there's one more thing we can do while we're here.",
    "80BD1B39": "Remember that big weapon we disabled? With all the clock-winding? It's almost back to fully functional.",
    "80BD1B3B": "There's a huge artillery cannon in another part of the base that's about to go online.",
    "80BD1B3D": "You two are pushing your luck out there.",
    "80BD1B3F": "Sometimes that's the only way to win, Dev.",
    "80BD1B49": "The power sources for those turrets are shielded, too! That's just excessive.",
    "80BD1CD3": "Get me to a console. I'll take care of them.",
    "80BD1CDD": "That's all of them. But as much I want us to get out of here...",
    "80BD1CDF": "There are two generators recharging their heavy tanks.",
    "80BD1CE3": "There are two generators recharging their heavy tanks. And you know how we feel about tanks.",
    "80BD1CE6": "In fact I do!",
    "80BD1CE8": "Red Legion dropships flying low over the church. Heads up!",
    "80BD0875": "We're almost there, but everything's locked down. We really did make them paranoid.",
    "80BD0877": "Pretty great, huh?",
    "80BD0879": "It will be great, when they reach those turrets and give them a good thrashing.",
    "80BD1CEA": "Perfect. The next time that big cannon tries to fire, it's not going to go well for the Red Legion.",
    "80BD1CEC": "Why wait?",
    "80BD1CF0": "That's a good point. Let's get to a maintenance console, and we'll start a firing sequence!",
    "80BD0881": "This seems familiar. But look out the window.",
    "80BD0883": "Does that mean you can see the turrets?",
    "80BD0885": "Barely. We need to find a way out there.",
    "80BD0887": "Welcome back to Firebase Hades. The fun never stops, does it? Luckily, they're off their game. ",
    "80BD0889": "Red Legion's still reeling from you taking out Thumos, so we've stepped up our air raids.",
    "80BD088B": "Red Legion's still reeling after you took down Ghaul, so we've stepped up our air strikes.",
    "80BD088D": "And in turn, they've stepped up thier defenses at the base. Some kind of anti-aircraft fire. Think you could find out more?",
    "80BD088F": "Absolutely.",
    "80BD1CF2": "You two have definitely earned your keep today. Red Legion's gonna be furious.",
    "80BD1CF4": "May I suggest calling it a day? Before the entire base comes down on your heads?",
    "80BD1CF6": "Ahh, you worry too much, Devrim!",
    "80BD1CF8": "I don't know what's gotten into him, but I like it!",
    "80BD0899": "You're right, Devrim. They've installed anti-aircraft turrets all over the base.",
    "80BD089B": "And with how paranoid you've made the Legion, I'm betting they're pretty well guarded.",
    "80BD089E": "Red Legion Psions are bad enough. But if they really have Taken powers?",
    "80BD08A2": "Since when did Cabal and Taken start sharing toys, anyway?",
    "80BD08A4": "We can figure out the connection later. For now, we must uncover the source of this energy.",
    "80BD1CFA": "Did you see that? He got stunned when we took out his Psion.",
    "80BD1CFC": "Severing their bond must cause a backlash to the host. Interesting.",
    "80BD1CFE": "Am I the only one who has no idea what any of you are talking about?",
    "80BD1D00": "Yes.",
    "80BD08AE": "Got it! I pulled location data from that Centurion. But we have to go... into the forest.",
    "80BD08B0": "You sure about that, buddy? Don't wanna get, you know, eaten by a creepy Taken shadow tree.",
    "80BD08B2": "Cayde, what exactly happened to you on Nessus?",
    "80BD1D02": "Okay, there are a lot more Cabal than I was expecting.",
    "80BD1D0C": "They may not like you trespassing in their secret magic fort.",
    "80BD08B8": "That Psion... is it shielding that Centurion?",
    "80BD08BA": "Shielding? Then they are harnessing the energy of the Taken. But how?",
    "80BD1D0E": "They get eaten yet?",
    "80BD08BE": "No good. Taken energy readings are increasing. I bet it's spreading to Psions all over the area.",
    "80BD08C0": "If that's true, it could bring a plague of shadow beyond our imagining.",
    "80BD08C2": "Ikora, you're freaking them out.",
    "80BD1D10": "Big Taken. Taken Cabal! Big... Taken Cabal!",
    "80BD1D12": "A Colossus. Of course. You must destroy it.",
    "80BD1D14": "Working on it!",
    "80BD1D16": "That portal connects to the forest. The Psions found a way to force it open!",
    "80BD1D18": "Well, it was nice knowing you.",
    "80BD1D1A": "Cayde.",
    "80BD1D33": "Whew! We did it. They're all gone.",
    "80BD1D36": "That'll set the Legion back a ways. Serves 'em right for messing with things they don't understand.",
    "80BD1D38": "Which is your area of expertise, after all. As for you, Guardian: well done. If that brute had gotten loose with the Psions, there may have been no stopping it.",
    "80BD1D3A": "And then I couldn't have collected on that bet! Big and Taken. Told you.",
    "80BD08BC": "They get eaten yet?",
    "80BD1D3C": "No, they did not 'get eaten yet'. But use caution. We don't know what's waiting in that forest.",
    "80BD1D3E": "My Glimmer's on something big and Taken.",
    "80BD1D40": "That may be the safest bet you've made in years.",
    "80BD08E2": "Yello, Cayde speaking. Oh, hang on, someone left a note here. 'EDZ forest. Taken energy, question mark. Red Legion... Brian.' ...who's Brian?",
    "80BD08E4": "Red Legion Psions. Guardian, we've heard disturbing reports from your area. They tell of Cabal with new powers.",
    "80BD08E6": "That sounds ominous. We'll keep an eye out for any unusual psionic energy nearby.",
    "80BD1D42": "Hey, Ikora?",
    "80BD1D44": "Good to hear your voice again. What did you find?",
    "80BD1D46": "I'm not sure. Some kind of machine. It's enhancing their Ether somehow.",
    "80BD08F1": "Good news, Devrim. It's not just you. There is something different about these Fallen.",
    "80BD08F3": "Somehow that doesn't make me feel any better.",
    "80BD1D48": "Ah, the direct approach. Well, if it means they can't make any more of that stuff, I'm all for it.",
    "80BD1D4A": "But the Fallen are resourceful. This isn't over. I must go and meditate on how to end this crisis.",
    "80BD1D4C": "Always thinking about the big picture, that one. Head back to the church, you two. Let's figure out our next move.",
    "80BD0901": "It's something in their Ether. Traces of Cabal technology.",
    "80BD0903": "Ether only provides sustenance for the Fallen. If they're augmenting it for some other purpose",
    "80BD0905": "I've gotten pretty good at isolating Cabal signatures. Let me see if there's something around here I can trace.",
    "80BD1D4E": "These energy barriers are throttling our communications. Whatever we're doing down here, we'd better do it fast.",
    "80BD1D50": "Say again? You're breaking up a bit.",
    "80BD1D52": "The Fallen made some kind of electromagnetic cage to hide what they're doing. No wonder we couldn't find the source.",
    "80BD1D54": "Devrim, do you still have their signal?",
    "80BD1D56": "No luck, mum. We might have lost them down there.",
    "80BD0915": "Have you two noticed any strange Fallen nearby? I swear I've caught sight of four-armed creatures that were glowing.",
    "80BD0917": "We've all been through a lot, Devrim. Staying in your church tower for this long might have taken a toll.",
    "80BD1D58": "Wow! Cabal technology does not handle power fluctuations well.",
    "80BD1D5A": "Did something explode? Was it an explosion? How was it?",
    "80BD1D5C": "Oh, it was it was fine. Nothing special.",
    "80BD0922": "Got it. That's enough to synthesize a new access code and get us inside.",
    "80BD0924": "You can make a key by shooting bad guys? I gotta talk to my Ghost.",
    "80BD0926": "Ugh. The Legion's a bit paranoid about security. That code won't last long.",
    "80BD0928": "Ah, the best things never do. Get a move on, you two.",
    "80BD1D5E": "Uh, we're in trouble! Their defenses are linked to the alarm system.",
    "80BD1D60": "Ooh, smart!  I mean, oh no!",
    "80BD1D62": "If they are connected, deactivating the barriers should buy you time before the alarm sounds.",
    "80BD0930": "Forcefield down. But there are more. A lot more.",
    "80BD0932": "This is getting too complicated. Isn't there anything you can you know, blow up?",
    "80BD0934": "Actually….",
    "80BD0936": "Ah, Guardians.",
    "80BD1D64": "[cut]",
    "80BD1D66": "That's the last one! And I've got a read on those backup generators ahead.",
    "80BD1D68": "Finally, our real target. Take them out, and the sudden power loss should overload all the connected systems.",
    "80BD1D6A": "Ah, wish I could be there for the explosions. I never get to see the good stuff.",
    "80BD1D6C": "Take that, Red Legion! Now we have the power.",
    "80BD1D6E": "Uh, not wild about that one. Whaddya think, Dev?",
    "80BD1D70": "I think you should stick to the clever turns of phrase. Their actions speak louder than words. Especially yours.",
    "80BD1D7C": "Come on, how did I end up the jerk here?",
    "80BD1D7E": "One of life's great mysteries, I suppose.",
    "80BD094A": "Ah, it's you again. Excellent. We have a unique opportunity.",
    "80BD094C": "My dear Devrim, you just said the magic words.",
    "80BD094E": "Ah, Cayde-6. So glad you could join us.",
    "80BD0950": "Course you are. Listen, Guardian, we've got a unique opportunity. Tell him, Dev.",
    "80BD0952": "Ugh. The Red Legion's looking to upgrade the power systems in their base. For a limited time, they've switched to backup generators.",
    "80BD0954": "Which means they'll have beefed up the security.",
    "80BD0956": "I can handle that part. Red Legion troops in the area will have security keys. Get me enough of those and we're in.",
    "80BD1D80": "Ugh, not fast enough. They're sending reinforcements our way!",
    "80BD1D82": "Don't worry. Got plenty of advice for this exact situation.",
    "80BD1D84": "Let me guess—shoot them?",
    "80BD1D86": "Come on, Dev, y—you ruined it!",
    "80BD0961": "That did it. All the blights are gone.",
    "80BD0965": "Except for the ones all across the solar system that will continue to happen for eternity, or at least until the sun burns out.",
    "80BD0967": "That has not been scientifically proven. But otherwise, well done, research group.",
    "80BD0969": "The Red Legion has shown a measurable vulnerability to concentrated entropy. Definitely worthy of further study.",
    "80BD096B": "Now the Taken and Cabal fight until everyone's dead. Cool.",
    "80BD0977": "Ahh, assistant. You are just in time to join my Dimensional Anomaly Research Group!",
    "80BD0979": "Captain, hello! Asher Mir says that I will provide the computational support, and you will provide the brute force! He is very rude.",
    "80BD097B": "Let us begin with barbaric close combat against the Taken. It is a scientifically sound proposition and is in no way suspicious.",
    "80BD097D": "We're almost to the research base. So we just walk around. But in a Taken-y way.",
    "80BD097F": "The Taken will think you're one of them, and flood into the European Dead Zone! Asher Mir said it would be a like a plague. And a scourge!",
    "80BD0981": "That outcome is only guaranteed if we do not destroy the blights. Do not overload the test subject with extraneous data!",
    "80BD0983": "'Test subject?'",
    "80BD0985": "This much Taken radiation can't be healthy.",
    "80BD0987": "Nonsense! There is no continuing danger from exposure to Taken radiation.",
    "80BD0989": "Incorrect, Asher Mir. I will now list all fourteen permanent debilitating effects from long-term contact with extradimensional matter.",
    "80BD098B": "No need for that. Assistant, continue the experiment. Make your way to the Red Legion's 'research' facility.",
    "80BD098D": "Looks like someone else made the same calculations as Asher. Let's go help them out!",
    "80BD098F": "What! Impossible. You must go prove that mine were superior!",
    "80BD0991": "Something feels different. I think it's working.",
    "80BD0993": "They're gonna get Taken",
    "80BD0995": "Excellent!",
    "80BD0997": "He means that you have performed the correct actions. The Taken will now flood into the surrounding area like a scourge.",
    "80BD0999": "And therefore, the experiment has progressed. Destroy the blights, immediately!",
    "80BD099C": "Whew, one Fallen Walker sent back to the scrap heap.",
    "80BD09A0": "You've earned a break.",
    "80BD09A2": "And a victory like this will ensure a respite for us as well. Excellent work.",
    "80BD09A4": "Hey, Zavala. Guess who pinged our beacon near that Fallen Pike gang?",
    "80BD09A6": "Fallen? All we see around here are Cabal.",
    "80BD09A8": "The Red Legion must have strengthened their defenses against mobile assault.",
    "80BD09AA": "Tell you what. Those Pikers can wait. Take out the Legion first. I bet they won't expect you to do it with their vehicles.",
    "80BD09AC": "These vehicles aren't as maneuverable as a Sparrow, but they pack a punch.",
    "80BD09AE": "Keep punching. You have a golden opportunity to put the Red Legion down for the count.",
    "80BD09B0": "Remind me to never get into a boxing match with a Titan. You all are scary.",
    "80BD09B2": "But as much as I hate to agree with him, Zavala's right. Vehicular mayhem now, Pike gang later.",
    "80BD09B4": "Oooo, he's feisty!",
    "80BD09B6": "Picking up a big spike in Fallen chatter. They sound pretty pissed.",
    "80BD09B8": "I think we can handle whatever they throw at us.",
    "80BD09BA": "They've deployed a Walker to your position.",
    "80BD09BC": "Huh.",
    "80BD09BE": "Hmm. That Fallen Pike gang is still a threat.",
    "80BD09C0": "Took the words right out of my mouth. Let's not make this a habit, huh?",
    "80BD09C2": "We'll see. Be careful out there. Those Pikes were rebuilt with scavenged technology. They may be unpredictable opponents.",
    "80BD09C4": "That'll teach the Fallen to not mess with us.",
    "80BD09C6": "Don't let your guard down. The gang's leader will be close.",
    "80BD09C8": "Not for long.",
    "80BD09CB": "Ah, thanks for checking in, you two! We've had our fill of Red Legion patrols and Fallen raids. We could use a spot of help with both.",
    "80BD09CF": "See if you can track down a Fallen comms terminal. Dev's got an idea that's crazy enough to work.",
    "80BD09D1": "Ah, it's difficult for the young to recognize the wisdom of experience.",
    "80BD1D88": "Great work! Broadcasting the message now. I decided to go with a House of Devils accent. Remember them?",
    "80BD1D8A": "Oh boy.",
    "80BD1D8C": "Ah, House of Devils, eh? You know the most interesting thing about their proununciation?",
    "80BD1D8E": "Great work! Broadcasting the message now. I decided to go with a Marauder accent.",
    "80BD1D90": "Why would you",
    "80BD1D92": "Marauder, eh? You know the thing that really lights my candle about their language?",
    "80BD09DF": "I don't blame you for wanting to blow everything up. Guess my deep scan will need to be a deep, deep scan, though.",
    "80BD1D94": "I could hear the explosions all the way back here. I bet it was quite a show!",
    "80BD1D96": "Which means the Fallen and Red Legion heard it, too. We'll let them shoot at each other for a while, and clean up whatever's left. Great work.",
    "80BD09E5": "I can't believe we have to go back into the mines again.",
    "80BD09E7": "Chin up, you two! Good news:  you'll be able to use a Fallen teleporter to reach the top! Ehh ... bad news, they've wired the place to explode.",
    "80BD09E9": "Excellent. What say you use your access to prepare a broadcast in Fallen-speak? I've been meaning to put this Cabal communications cipher to use.",
    "80BD09EB": "The Red Legion fighting the Fallen for a change? Great idea! I can extract archived audio transmissions from any Fallen in the area.",
    "80BD1DC7": "Actually, Devrim, let's keep the channel clear. You know. To, uh, make sure there's no interference during the transmat!",
    "80BD09EF": "If I run a deep scan of the tunnels, we can borrow all these traps and explosives.",
    "80BD09F1": "And put them to good use sowing chaos between your enemies. A lovely idea.",
    "80BD1DCA": "Lot of big red ships headed your way. Whatever you said, it got their attention.",
    "80BD09F5": "Got it. Now I can transmat these horribly dangerous explosives wherever we need.",
    "80BD1DCC": "I told them that Ghaul ran away and cried when we retook the City. Big, ugly crying.",
    "80BD1DCE": "I used a pretty nasty word to describe Ghaul. I don't want to repeat it here.",
    "80BD09FB": "I've got enough for a pretty convincing Fallen impression.",
    "80BD09FD": "Don't mention accents around Dev unless you want a day-long lecture about City dialects.",
    "80BD09FF": "Meantime, best sightline to Red Legion air support is the cliffside where you and I set up that refugee beacon.",
    "80BD0A01": "No one appreciates the finer things anymore.",
    "80BD1DD0": "Ah, I do so love unconventional warfare. I'd be on the lookout for drop pods, if I were you.",
    "80BD0A06": "Well, that was as good as advertised.",
    "80BD0A0A": "The Red Legion has brought a new weapon online, one powerful enough to threaten the Farm and everything around it.",
    "80BD0A0C": "While you're in transit, I'll try and fill in the gaps.",
    "80BD0A0E": "Back in the City militia, we used to see the Fallen try to repurpose technology from other races and fail rather explosively.",
    "80BD0A10": "Conversations with Devrim surfaced a memory from my studies: the Cabal are made up of many different races. They have always struggled to adapt to a single technology.",
    "80BD0A12": "I'm not sure I understand.",
    "80BD0A14": "That new weapon is an artillery cannon too big for you to blow up. But you could exploit that weakness.",
    "80BD0A16": "The thing with the power cores. Sold.",
    "80BD0A18": "Ah, it's you! Ikora will be pleased.",
    "80BD0A1A": "Guardian, I need you to test a theory. Find a power core in a disabled Red Legion tank, install it in a supply console, and stand back.",
    "80BD0A1E": "That artillery cannon will be offline for minutes. I mean, weeks. I think.",
    "80BD0A20": "The Cabal never were very good at details. Good thing for us.",
    "80BD0A22": "This is another step to ending them for good. Well done, Guardian.",
    "80BD0A24": "Okay, munitions system unlocked. Now to expose the power cores, I need to override the maintenance schedule.",
    "80BD0A28": "We never seem to be finished with this base. Where do we start?",
    "80BD0A2A": "From what we've observed, the munition power cores are only exposed during recurring maintenance windows.",
    "80BD0A2C": "Then I suggest you force a maintenance window.",
    "80BD0A3F": "Be on your guard. The Red Legion must have heard all the commotion. I've seen Harvesters flying about the area.",
    "80BD0A43": "Bet they want some payback for the Fallen stealing their stuff. I can relate.",
    "80BD1DD2": "This must be the place, but there's no Fallen. And the Ether must be cloaked.",
    "80BD1DD4": "Then let's get the neighbors to uncloak it! Why don't you send up a couple of flares and see how some Red Legion shock troops shake things up?",
    "80BD0A49": "That is a big barrier. No wonder I could detect it so far away.",
    "80BD0A4B": "The bigger the barrier, the bigger the cache. How are you going to get it down?",
    "80BD0A4D": "Don't overthink it. Go punch some Fallen, see if they've got the keycode.",
    "80BD1DD6": "It's hard to tell with all the cloaking, but I think we got it all.",
    "80BD1DD8": "Seems likely: I just caught a glimpse of a Servitor headed for the mines. Never seen one like it.",
    "80BD1DDA": "Ten glimmer says THAT'S the one making all the modified Ether! Don't miss this chance, you two.",
    "80BD1DDC": "Okay, just... let us enjoy this one for a minute.",
    "80BD0A57": "There's nothing left in these cores. All the Ether's been drained out of them.",
    "80BD0A59": "But there's another cache close by. ",
    "80BD0A5B": "There's a Fallen teleporter here. I think I can brute force my way past their security, but not quickly.",
    "80BD0A5D": "No choice. You're gonna have to kick down the door, little guy.",
    "80BD0A5F": "What is it with mysterious, hooded, anti-authority types calling me little?",
    "80BD0A61": "Don't call me little.",
    "80BD0A63": "Hah! No keycodes. But I think this explosive will work just as well.",
    "80BD0A65": "Okay. Think outside the box. If I were several containers of artificially enhanced Ether, where would I be?",
    "80BD0A67": "Keep it simple. The Fallen are desperate. They're trying to hide something. How did they do it last time?",
    "80BD0A69": "Well ... they used a set of barriers to keep us out. I'm detecting one nearby. Let's go!",
    "80BD1DDE": "We found your Harvesters, Devrim.",
    "80BD1DE0": "They're hard to miss. Actually... hang on a sec.",
    "80BD1DE2": "They must have cloaked it again. Devious.",
    "80BD0A72": "This tunnel looks promising.",
    "80BD0A76": "Fallen banners. We're definitely on the right track.",
    "80BD1DE4": "Just before you took out that Captain, I fried all their broadcast capabilities. No more jamming.",
    "80BD1DE6": "That means people will be coming to the Farm from all over the planet. Once we get that last relay set up, we can reach out to the rest of the system!",
    "80BD1DF2": "Then we can start rallying Guardians to strike back against the Red Legion.",
    "80BD1DF8": "There will be plenty of time for both. For now, head back here when you can, you two.",
    "80BD0A80": "This core... it's acting as a kind of broadband amplifier. Their signal is blocking transmissions all across the dial.",
    "80BD0A82": "After all the work you did setting up Suraya's broadcast? That just won't do.",
    "80BD0A84": "That won't do. We need the airwaves to be clear if we're to reach those poor souls who fled The City.",
    "80BD0A86": "There's a signal antenna nearby. I can use the core to try to find the source of whatever the Fallen are doing.",
    "80BD0A88": "I lost the connect. The Fallen are jamming us.",
    "80BD1DFA": "This is it. Hold them off, and I'll use that Shank core to shut down the signal remotely.",
    "80BD1DFC": "With that shield down, I can finally get a read on the source. It's close.",
    "80BD0A8E": "I found the source. It's underground. DEEP underground.",
    "80BD0A90": "That figures. Fallen love dark places.",
    "80BD0A92": "Especially with the Red Legion all over the Dead Zone.",
    "80BD0A94": "I'm getting some weird feedback on the comms.",
    "80BD0A96": "Dev, did you put your teacup on the broadcast switch again?",
    "80BD0A98": "Looks like these Fallen Shanks are rerouting the signal.",
    "80BD0A9A": "Try dismantling one and taking a close look at the insides.",
    "80BD0A9C": "There are hovering Fallen drones all over the EDZ. Try taking a peek at one of their cores. That'll tell us why this feedback is happening.",
    "80BD1DFE": "They're really built up down here. We need to remember this place after we retake The City—so we can clear it out for good.",
    "80BD1E00": "Or we could let the Fallen have their creepy caves, and NOT sacrifice more people.",
    "80BD0AA2": "Why do you think they're trying to jam us, Dev?",
    "80BD0AA4": "They missed their opportunity to take over this area after our friend touched the Shard.",
    "80BD0AA6": "And now they're too scared to fight us head-on. Typical Fallen.",
    "80BD1E02": "Just a little longer",
    "80BD0AAB": "Well, I guess one crate is better than zero. Transmatted your way, Amanda.",
    "80BD0AAF": "Not so fast. I'm sending you coordinates a short ways from your position.",
    "80BD0AB1": "I've got a fix on it, too. I'll head over that way. Last one to the courtyard's a Dreg-face.",
    "80BD0AB3": "How colorful.",
    "80BD1E04": "Turrets are down.",
    "80BD1E06": "Appreciate it, but I don't wanna risk gettin' hit by some lucky sniper shot.",
    "80BD1E08": "A real sniper doesn't rely on luck! But ah... try to clear out that courtyard, you two.",
    "80BD1E0A": "Sky looks clear. I'm headed your way to pick up the goods. The Farm'll really appreciate it. Heckuva job, you two.",
    "80BD1E0C": "Quite. Now, do me a favor and see if there's any tea still intact?",
    "80BD1E0E": "Not all clear. Definitely not all clear.",
    "80BD1E10": "Too hot for me to help out.",
    "80BD1E12": "I don't have line of sight, either. You're on your own, you two. Be brave, as they say.",
    "80BD1E14": "We're here. And we've got company.",
    "80BD1E16": "Red-bellies dug in and set up a whole bunch o' turrets. Clear 'em out, would ya?",
    "80BD0AC9": "Hey, long time no see, you two! Dev, you didn't tell me he was in town.",
    "80BD0ACB": "Ms. Holliday and I have been reappropriating supplies from the Cabal. She's keeping a low profile at the moment.",
    "80BD0ACD": "You tag the boxes, I'll fly 'em out. Can't wait.",
    "80BD1E18": "Hang on a sec. Dev, you seeing what I see?",
    "80BD1E1A": "Indeed. Another cache of supplies. But these are a bit familiar, aren't they?",
    "80BD1E1C": "Those toothy-faced Ether-chuggers. They took our stuff!",
    "80BD1E1E": "So the Fallen stole from us, before we stole what they stole from the Red Legion?",
    "80BD1E20": "All's fair in love and war, I suppose.",
    "80BD1E22": "Do me a favor and plop down a beacon, would ya?",
    "80BD1E24": "Signal's green. Here I come.",
    "80BD1E26": "Those supplies should keep the Farm up and running for a while. Another job well done.",
    "80BD0AE1": "Figures those four-armed bandits would try to beat us to it. Don't let 'em!",
    "80BD1E28": "Secure that cache, and Ms. Holliday will be by in two shakes.",
    "80BD1E2A": "No can do, Dev. Could be a hundred Fallen hidin' out in those buildings. I'll wait for the all-clear.",
    "80BD0AE8": "We can use the login from that quartermaster for a remote detonation.",
    "80BD0AEB": "Using their explosives to blow up their tanks. I have pretty good ideas.",
    "80BD0AED": "No argument here.",
    "80BD0AEF": "They're offline, like she said.",
    "80BD0AF1": "Perfect! Now, you can re-transmat those explosives.",
    "80BD0AF3": "Hawthorne, that is some good improvisation.",
    "80BD0AF5": "There are heavy tanks near your position. Get out of there before they come online.",
    "80BD0AF7": "Wait, wait, wait! Head outside, you two!",
    "80BD0AF9": "The tanks are outside.",
    "80BD0AFB": "Trust me!",
    "80BD0AFD": "Okay, I'm going to arm all the explosives at once. Keep me close so there's no signal interference.",
    "80BD0AFF": "You're gonna get plenty of other interference from the Legion.",
    "80BD0B01": "Hold that position. Those tanks are too important a target to leave standing.",
    "80BD0B03": "I bet that was quite a show.",
    "80BD0B05": "A well-timed tactical withdrawal is probably wise.",
    "80BD0B07": "Much as I hate running, Sloane's right. Get out of there, you two.",
    "80BD0B09": "Whoever this was had a delivery manifest. It says most of the explosives are already gone, but there are still some left in the base.",
    "80BD0B0B": "No problem. Sloane says you can use your transmat juice to blow 'em up in a safe location.",
    "80BD0B0D": "'Transmat juice?'",
    "80BD0B0F": "Oh, like you know how it works.",
    "80BD0B11": "That's not relevant. Get into that base, and find those explosives.",
    "80BD0B13": "Good, someone I can count on. The Cabal are moving high-yield explosives through that base. You need to neutralize them before they're used against us.",
    "80BD0B15": "I still think we can put them to use somehow, but I'm letting Sloane have this one. Either way, we need their location.",
    "80BD0B17": "We're clear.",
    "80BD0B19": "We'll try to track down the explosives that got away. In the meantime, great work. Those tanks would have been a lot to handle.",
    "80BD0B1B": "We make a great team, everyone. Let's do this again sometime.",
    "80BD0B1E": "If we want to keep it together out here in the wild, we'll need more supplies.",
    "80BD0B22": "We're getting some wild readings from enemies near your location. See if you can get your hands on the source.",
    "80BD0B24": "Just got off the comms with Tyra. That woman sure knows her history. She's looking for any lost Golden Age tech you run across. Keep your eyes peeled.",
    "80BD0B26": "Keeping our comm network running out here is putting a major strain on our resources. Anything you pick up in the wild will really help us out.",
    "80BD0B28": "Got some reports of bad guys running around with scavenged tech. You see anyone carrying something they shouldn't, take it off their hands.",
    "80BD0B2A": "If we want to keep hold of the EDZ, we have to focus on survival first. And that means supplies. See if you can get the bad guys to share some of theirs.",
    "80BD0B2C": "Some scouts from the Farm spotted some suspicious targets near you. They're packing some things we'd like to get our hands on. You up for it?",
    "80BD0B2E": "Everything we take from our enemies makes them weaker and us stronger. Go shift the balance in our favor, will you?",
    "80BD0B30": "Enemies near you are carrying things that don't belong to them. Let's go take back what's ours!",
    "80BD0B32": "You ready for some diplomacy? Track down these targets, and convince them to donate their resources to the Farm. Pretty reasonable, right?",
    "80BD0B34": "Make no mistake, we are fighting a guerrilla war here. That means scrapping for every resource we can. It's not civilized, but it is necessary.",
    "80BD0B36": "Supplies are running low. I have a lead for you if you don't mind. Manifest is attached.",
    "80BD0B38": "Oh, dear. The comms gear is very particular about how it wants to operate. Find these supplies for me, won't you? We'll make it work.",
    "80BD0B3A": "We're keen to acquire a few resources from the field. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.",
    "80BD0B3C": "Ah, hello. You caught me mid-cup here. Manifest attached for a supplies run. If you'd be so kind.",
    "80BD0B3E": "Every day in the Dead Zone is a struggle. The supplies we're looking for will make tomorrow a little brighter than today.",
    "80BD0B40": "I tried to ask my neighbors for a few odds and ends. They were unkind in their response. Do me a favor? Force their hand.",
    "80BD0B42": "I see a great deal from up here. For instance, supplies that would reinforce the Farm. If you would?",
    "80BD0B44": "Comms network requires constant attention. Manifest attached, for some materials that will make this all just a little bit easier.",
    "80BD0B46": "I never thought we'd be reduced to scavenging. But here we are. I have a list, if you have the time.",
    "80BD0B5D": "Ah, my friend. There are enemies massing nearby. Perhaps now would be a good time to deal with them? Before their numbers grow.",
    "80BD0B61": "I may be a damn good shot. But one old man in a tower can only do so much. If you would be so kind?",
    "80BD0B63": "I'm tracking an enemy band moving with purpose. Perhaps you could, um discourage them from moving any further?",
    "80BD0B65": "Guardian, yes. I had just put a pot on to brew when word came across of this, um unpleasantness. If you would?",
    "80BD0B67": "Time to let your gun do the talking, Guardian. See the attached details.",
    "80BD0B69": "Unchecked, the enemy would move as a flood against us. We must hold back the tide, my friend. ",
    "80BD0B6B": "The enemy has posed us a problem. I do believe you're the solution. In your own time, my friend.",
    "80BD0B6D": "A bit of a tussle ahead of you. If you don't mind rolling up your sleeves, that is? Details attached.",
    "80BD0B6F": "One day I shall return to the City. For now, there are plenty of battles ahead. This one, I believe, is yours.",
    "80BD0B71": "The translation software I have here is a bit rusty, but I believe they are saying some extremely rude things about your mother. ",
    "80BD0B73": "I have word of a scout cut off by enemy patrols. If you could see to clearing a way home, I'd be ever so grateful.",
    "80BD0B75": "Spot of bother here, Guardian. My neighbors aren't the friendliest. You understand. Details attached.",
    "80BD0B77": "Enemies think they can keep pushing us and we won't push back. Time to show 'em how wrong they are.",
    "80BD0B79": "Winning the war and saving the big white thing may be important, but the rest of humanity still needs our help. Let's get to it.",
    "80BD0B7B": "Looking at reports that show increased enemy presence near your position. You in the mood for some crowd control?",
    "80BD0B7D": "Hearing there are enemies massing for an assault on the Farm. Go talk 'em out of it, huh?",
    "80BD0B7F": "Bunch of bad guys out there that could use some company. Go introduce yourself.",
    "80BD0B81": "Outside the walls, sometimes all you've got is your wits, and the occasional Guardian passing through. There's an enemy patrol getting too close for comfort. Think you can take them out?",
    "80BD0B83": "More enemy mobilizations. Color me surprised. Best I can tell, you're the only one close enough to stop them.",
    "80BD0B85": "Got a mission here that's right up your alley: bad guys. Lots of 'em. Can you take 'em down?",
    "80BD0B87": "Got a lead on some bad guys that need shooting. Think you can throw some ammo their way?",
    "80BD0B89": "I know you've got wars to win and Red Legion to fight, but we could use some help with a hotspot near you.",
    "80BD0B8B": "We've got hostile forces gearing up for an attack near you, but we don't know their target. Stop 'em before we find out the hard way.",
    "80BD0B8D": "Bad guys are grouping up into a larger force near you. I hear they've been making fun of the Traveler. You gonna let 'em get away with that?",
    "80BD0BBE": "A scout from the Farm was out trying to secure an on-site scan. She had to retreat, but I'm betting you'll do just fine.",
    "80BD0BC0": "Hawthorne was adamant we obtain a scan, and insists I cut back on my tea. Says it will unsteady my nerves. Ha! At least we can help with the scan.",
    "80BD0BC2": "One of my favorite authors offered the maxim, 'Know your enemy.' An on-site scan would go a long way here, my friend.",
    "80BD0BC4": "If you'd be so kind, Guardian, we could use a scan at this location. I am sending you the details—and my thanks.",
    "80BD0BC6": "Our scouts have struggled to secure a scan at this location. I suspect you may enjoy more success.",
    "80BD0BC8": "The utility of this whatever this is remains unknown. Only a close scan will provide us the answers we need. If you don't mind?",
    "80BD0BCA": "I've been picking up anomalous readings through the comms relay. A scan at these coordinates could help me clear out the noise. And lessen my headache.",
    "80BD0BCC": "Ah, Guardian. Hawthorne and I are engaging in a friendly wager. An on-site scan would allow us to settle up. If you please?",
    "80BD0BCE": "Oh! Ooh, that's hot. Ah! Guardian. Yes, I have, um a scan! Yes. If you wouldn't mind following up? Very good, then.",
    "80BD0BD0": "We are considering expanding the comms network. A scan, just here, would help us make our decision. If you could oblige?",
    "80BD0BD2": "Got a blind spot in our readings out there. Sending you the coordinates. See what you can find.",
    "80BD0BD4": "Enemy's getting too comfortable out there. That's bad for us. We need to find out what they're up to, and figure out how to hit 'em back.",
    "80BD0BD6": "There's a spot near you that could use an intel refresh. Think you could swing by for us? It'd make a lot of people happy. Maybe even me.",
    "80BD0BD8": "I know you've got the great big war to worry about, but if you've got a few minutes to do a quick scan for us, it would mean a lot.",
    "80BD0BDA": "Reports are coming in showing a lot of enemy activity at these coordinates. If they're up to something big, I want to know what it is.",
    "80BD0BDC": "Remember that time I picked you up off the ground? Well, I need a hand with picking up some intel. And before you ask: it doesn't make us even.",
    "80BD0BDE": "Information goes a long way in keeping us ahead of the bad guys. A scan of these coordinates would really help us out. Let me know what you find.",
    "80BD0BE0": "Been picking up weird signals from these coordinates. Can't sleep until I know what's causing them. And you don't want to get between me and my sleep.",
    "80BD0BE2": "One of our scouting patrols had to pull back after taking heavy fire. We didn't lose anyone, but they didn't get to their scan. Can you finish what they started?",
    "80BD0BE4": "There's a surge of enemy communications from a spot near you. All encrypted. Want to go do some eavesdropping?",
    "80BD0BE7": "While it's true I can see for miles, I'm just one old man. Coordinates on their way for a more detailed survey. Attached, find my thanks.",
    "80BD0BEB": "Hawthorne is keen for a better picture of this area. Patience was never one of her virtues, I'm afraid. We need someone there on the double.",
    "80BD0BED": "Our scouts are struggling to complete their surveys behind enemy lines. Perhaps someone of your stature would enjoy more success.",
    "80BD0BEF": "There is no substitute for eyes on the ground. If you could suss out enemy capabilities in this area, I'd be much obliged.",
    "80BD0BF1": "Every day we struggle to hold on to what little ground we have. To do that, we need up-to-date surveillance. That, my friend, is where you come in.",
    "80BD0BF3": "Hawthorne has concerns about the area detailed here. She certainly has a nose for trouble. Perhaps you'd be kind enough to follow up?",
    "80BD0BF5": "We believe this area holds some strategic importance for the enemy. Perhaps you could 'shed some Light' on the situation for us?",
    "80BD0BF7": "I've been tracking comings and goings from this area, but an explanation of their movements has so far eluded me. If you don't mind?",
    "80BD0BF9": "Got something that'll be a walk in the park for you. Get the lay of the land, shoot some bad guys. Sounds like fun, right?",
    "80BD0BFB": "Something about the enemy activity in your area doesn't smell right to me. Think you could go sniff it out?",
    "80BD0BFD": "Enemy chatter near you says that place is critical to whatever they're doing. See what you can find out!",
    "80BD0BFF": "Heads up! A few scouts had to pull back after taking fire. One of them's still unconscious. Enemy must be hiding something at that position.",
    "80BD0C01": "Need some intel on a nearby location. I'd ask one of the scouts, but we're stretched pretty thin. Can you help us out?",
    "80BD0C03": "Shaking up the enemy gives people hope these days—and hope was in short supply for a long time. Scope out this location, and it'd be a big win for us.",
    "80BD0C05": "I know you Guardians love to hit things, but here's a chance to give the bad guys a bloody nose without getting your knuckles dirty. See what you can find out.",
    "80BD0C07": "Got a scouting mission on deck. Could use someone whose Ghost can bring them back as many times as it takes. Know anyone who fits that description?",
    "80BD0C2C": "I have an enemy commander in my sights. I think the honor of this kill, however, is yours.",
    "80BD0C2E": "It would seem a certain high ranking enemy target has finally broken cover. Perhaps now may be a good time to relieve him of his duties?",
    "80BD0C30": "I've received word of a high value target operating in the area. I believe you can take him unwares  if you act now.",
    "80BD0C32": "Hmm. This won't do. Guardian, I believe a high value target might be tracking you. Do  track it back. Won't you?",
    "80BD0C34": "It would appear a target of some repute has been dropped in to inspect the troops. Perhaps he could use your assistance?",
    "80BD0C36": "I do believe there is a group shadowing your movements. Whatever is leading them, it's of significant size. Suggest you answer with force, my friend.",
    "80BD0C38": "My nights here are far colder than on they were on the Wall. But telling you we have the chance to take down an enemy commander? That warms me right up.",
    "80BD0C3A": "Hawthorne wants this target eliminated. Oblige her, if you would? You may rise - ever so slightly - in her estimation.",
    "80BD0C3C": "If there's one thing I can't stand, it's puffed-up leaders throwing their weight around. Go teach this one a lesson, huh?",
    "80BD0C3E": "You Guardians know that snapping the chain of command can really mess up the enemy. Think you could go cause some trouble for them?",
    "80BD0C40": "Well, well, well. Look who's come out to play. No, not you, Guardian. Enemy VIP, just popped up. Go give 'em a warm welcome.",
    "80BD0C42": "Think you could make some time to take down some top brass while you're out there? I'll throw the coordinates your way.",
    "80BD0C44": "Got sightings of a hostile commander near your position. Should be a good workout.",
    "80BD0C46": "Devrim's got eyes on a high-value target that's been tearing it up in your area. Go return the favor.",
    "80BD0C48": "There's an enemy commander in your area, and his guards have left him exposed. Could be the perfect time to take him out.",
    "80BD0C4A": "Don't get so focused on the giant ball in the sky that you forget about us normal people. They could use your help taking out a big target.",
    "80BD1E2D": "Good work down there, you two. Keep an eye out for other hidey holes and treasures like this one!",
    "80BD1E2F": "But that's for another day. In the meantime what say we get down to business? Come on back up to the church tower. I'm putting a kettle on now.",
    "80BD1E31": "Let's get started. There's a banner on the main floor. Give it a look, will you?",
    "80BD1E33": "I just snagged a keycode from that Captain. I think I can open his supply cache!",
    "80BD1E35": "This history of this region is fascinating. I believe tunnels and caves like the one you're in now stretch all across the EDZ.",
    "80BD1E37": "Who knows what's lurking down there. Be careful.",
    "80BD1E39": "Very well done. To survive we'll have to look for every opportunity. Keep your eyes peeled for more supplies in the wilds.",
    "80BD1E86": "Speaking of the wilds, there's a symbol on the wall of the church. Take a look.",
    "80BF5BA2": "This is the House of Judgement sigil. We used to work with a Fallen who flew this banner.",
    "80BF5BA9": "Curious. Well, the Fallen seem to have put this up as a bit of a threat. I imagine you'll find lots of objects like this out there with a bit of a story to them.",
    "80BF5BCB": "This is a Fallen House sigil. I don't recognize it, though.",
    "80BF5BD8": "Nor I. The Fallen seem to have put it up as something of a threat. I imagine you'll find lots of objects like this out there with a bit of a story to them.",
    "80BD1E8A": "Or both. Let's go check it out.",
    "80BD1E8C": "Devrim, where did this symbol come from?",
    "80BD1E8E": "I believe your City Hunters must have put them here and there about the region as they scouted around. I think they meant it to mark something special. Or dangerous.",
    "80BD1E90": "We both need some supplies to get going out here. See if you find a cache in one of the buildings nearby.",
    "80BD0C6F": "The cache is around here somewhere.",
    "80BD0C71": "We know the one you're talking about.",
    "80BD0C73": "Have you opened the cache yet?",
    "80BD0C75": "I think Devrim wanted me to scan this banner.",
    "80BD0C77": "Keep your eyes peeled for more caches. I expect the EDZ is rife with them.",
    "80BD0C79": "But first, come back to the church tower. We have work to do.",
    "80BD0C7B": "Bully for you! But you can't have found them all. Keep your eyes peeled.",
    "80BD0C7D": "We already found this cache.",
    "80BD0C7F": "Let's go see about these tunnels.",
    "80BD0C81": "We saw those tunnels before. Let's head back there.",
    "80BD0C83": "We already went down there. Took out a bunch of Fallen and found a big chest.",
    "80BD0C85": "You're even more industrious than Suraya said.",
    "80BD0C87": "Then do me the favor of checking out that banner on the ground floor of the church?",
    "80BD0C89": "Don't forget to come back upstairs. I have something else to show you.",
    "80BD0C8B": "One more thing, then... head back to the Church when you're ready.",
    "80BD0C8D": "This symbol doesn't look Fallen. Or Cabal. Curious.",
    "80BD0C8F": "We'll come back to it. Let's go look at what Devrim wanted us to see first.",
    "80BD0C91": "We'll come back to it. Let's see if we can find that cache.",
    "80BD0C93": "Let's go see if we can find that other cache Devrim was talking about.",
    "80BD0C95": "Seems like that symbol marks cache locations.",
    "80BD0C97": "I expect you'll find more caches out there. Keep your eyes peeled.",
    "80BD1E92": "We did it. They're gone.",
    "80BD1E94": "You Guardians really are something else. I guess I kind of forgot that.",
    "80BD1E96": "And now we know that there are resources to be found in the EDZ. Once we retake the City, that'll be a big help.",
    "80BD1E98": "Sure.",
    "80BD1E9A": "What Suraya means to say is 'thank you'. Head back here when you can, you two. There's still quite a bit to do.",
    "80BD1E9C": "There. I've got a clear signal. No more feedback.",
    "80BD1E9E": "Five by five here as well. Excellent work.",
    "80BD1EA0": "I have to admit, you're the most helpful Guardian I've ever met. But there's one more thing. Did I send those coordinates correctly?",
    "80BD1EA2": "It's nice to have a Guardian helping us normals for a change. But there's one more thing. Did I send those coordinates correctly?",
    "80BD1EA4": "I've got them. Through the tunnel, across the river.",
    "80BD1EA6": "That's the place. I left something behind there.",
    "80BD1EA8": "The area's clear.",
    "80BD1EAA": "Not for long. The Fallen don't like it when they're denied a good scavenge. They're bound to come at you in force.",
    "80BD1EAC": "Then do me another favor, you two. Drop another one of those node things to boost my signal, then get out of there.",
    "80BD1EAE": "Bad news, Hawthorne. The Fallen beat us here.",
    "80BD1EB0": "All right, forget the supplies. Clear out those Fallen and we'll figure out our next move.",
    "80BD1EB2": "Backup's incoming. Eyes up!",
    "80BD0CBE": "That's one node online.",
    "80BD0CC0": "Looks like the signal's already amped. That was fast.",
    "80BD0CC2": "Hang on a minute. I just spotted quite a few Fallen headed your way. Keep your guard up.",
    "80BD1EB4": "Fallen Skiff incoming!",
    "80BD1EB6": "Dammit! I'll see if you can get you any backup from the Farm.",
    "80BD0CC8": "After you shut down the Fallen's underground jamming equipment, they must be coming out of the caves.",
    "80BD0CCA": "Eliminating that Captain under the church must have drawn the rest of the Fallen out.",
    "80BD0CCC": "They won't stop coming. We need to make sure that signal is strong.",
    "80BD0CCE": "You better hurry up and place that second node.",
    "80BD1EB8": "If you've made them mad, you're doing something right. Don't let up!",
    "80BD0CD2": "All right, Devrim, what's next?",
    "80BD0CD4": "Helping me spread the word. We're broadcasting a signal from the Farm to people who fled the City saying, 'You'll be safe here.'",
    "80BD0CD6": "And we need to make sure everyone, everywhere can hear it.",
    "80BD0CD8": "Place a few signal amplifiers around the area to boost the signal! That should do the trick.",
    "80BD1EBA": "We're almost to your coordinates, Hawthorne.",
    "80BD1EBC": "Good. I left supplies there that I had to abandon in a hurry a while back.",
    "80BD1EBE": "Supplies for the Farm?",
    "80BD1EC0": "For the City. But when you all got attacked, I dropped everything and flew across the ocean to try and help.",
    "80BD1EC2": "But the City sure doesn't need it anymore. We could use that stuff at the Farm.",
    "80BD1EC4": "This place used to be so peaceful. This is the first time I've even seen any Fallen since the Cabal hit us.",
    "80BD1EC6": "Reminds me of the City. You all tried to make it so we never even laid eyes on a Dreg. To keep us safe, right?",
    "80BD1EC8": "There's another word for a place you're not allowed to leave—you know—with walls you can't see over, and guards everywhere.",
    "80BD1ECA": "Suraya, despite your exploits there, I hardly think the City was a prison.",
    "80BD1ECC": "I'm just saying—no walls at the Farm. Come and go whenever you want. So let's make sure everyone can get there, eh Guardian?",
    "80BD1ECE": "Good news, I'm reading another signal boost. Bad news, that feedback is bouncing around the airwaves again.",
    "80BD1ED0": "Hmm, the Fallen must have more jamming equipment in addition to what you disabled in the caves.",
    "80BD1ED2": "Hopeully we won't need a cave-in to knock these out.",
    "80BD1ED4": "I read the boosted signal. And some kind of strange feedback.",
    "80BD1ED6": "The Fallen are nothing if not persistent. I'd wager they have some kind of jamming devices nearby.",
    "80BD0CF9": "Good luck. Stay focused.",
    "80BD0CFD": "Fantastic work.",
    "80BD0CFF": "The Fallen won't recover from this any time soon. Exemplary.",
    "80BD0D01": "Head back this way when you have a minute, and we'll close this chapter out.",
    "80BD0D03": "More depleted Ether cores. Hmm.",
    "80BD0D05": "Perhaps you could scatter them like breadcrumbs and draw your quarry back to the surface.",
    "80BD0D07": "You're joking, Dev ... but that might actually work. Guardian, head back to Devrim's tower. You'll need some room for this to work.",
    "80BD0D09": "We've got an Archon Priest, and he's glowing.",
    "80BD0D0B": "Then some enhanced Ether still remains. Finish him quickly.",
    "80BD0D0D": "Hawthorne has asked Ikora to take her place. Something about, 'Knowing more about all that Fallen stuff.'",
    "80BD0D0F": "Meaning Ether distribution from Servitors to Kells, consequences when that supply is severed, subtleties of an Archon Priest versus a Captain",
    "80BD0D11": "Quite. What I know is that the Fallen are experts at getting up off the dirt. We'll be right back where we started, unless we take out the ones in charge.",
    "80BD0D13": "I'm reading multiple inbound Fallen ships. They're not going down without a fight!",
    "80BD0D15": "But they are going down.",
    "80BD0D17": "That Servitor will be vulnerable while it recharges. Find it, and destroy it.",
    "80BD0D1A": "Lovely. Let's keep moving. You're looking for a high-ranking Legion commander.",
    "80BD0D1E": "This is Commander Zavala. Who's on this channel?",
    "80BD0D20": "Devrim Kay, sir, and our favorite Guardian.",
    "80BD0D22": "Ah, is this the patrol set-up? Do you mind if I listen in?",
    "80BD0D24": "Be my guest. ",
    "80BD0D26": "Devrim here, subbing for Cayde. Righto. The Legion nicked the secure channel you Guardians use for your patrols.",
    "80BD0D28": "Naturally Cayde didn't leave any kind of instructions, so I suggest you rough up a few Cabal for the intel.",
    "80BD0D2A": "Access codes are in. I'm transferring broadcast permissions back to our patrol system.",
    "80BD0D2C": "Yes, we see it coming online now.",
    "80BD0D2E": "Ahem. The field beacons still need to be reactivated.",
    "80BD0D30": "Indeed. Make your way outside, if you please. You're looking for a patrol beacon. They're fiddly little batons jammed into the ground.",
    "80BD0D32": "Well done. If you're keen to run more support missions, keep your eyes peeled for patrol beacons.",
    "80BD0D34": "I'm watching the rest of the network come online now, all across the system. You should be able to pick up patrols on any planet.",
    "80BD0D36": "Ah Who among us does not love infrastructure?",
    "80BD0D38": "Indeed. Oh, and give my regards to Cayde when you see him, won't you?",
    "80BD0D3A": "Excellent. There should be a terminal nearby. Input the key, and we'll—oh, I'm sorry, Devrim, I should have let you handle this.",
    "80BD0D3C": "No, no. Go ahead. ",
    "80BD0D3E": "I think we've narrowed in on that frequency.",
    "80BD0D40": "Brilliant. Thin out the ground troops a bit. You won't want anyone following you when you go in to reclaim our channel.",
    "80BD0D42": "Right. Have a quick peek around. We want things quiet before you pop into that Legion base.",
    "80BD0D44": "Dev? Are you all doing Cayde's chores?",
    "80BD0D46": "We are. Care to pitch in?",
    "80BD0D48": "No, no thanks. Haha. In fact, uh, something just came up; I'm gonna hop off. Good luck!",
    "80BD1ED8": "We need everyone on the elevator!",
    "80BD1EDA": "That did it. Killing the Servitor brought the power back on.",
    "80BD1EDC": "Power's back on. ",
    "80BD1EDE": "Good job! Maybe I'll finally get my booster one of these days.",
    "80BD1EE0": "Elevator's not working. Power must be out.",
    "80BD1EE2": "And we've upset the Fallen.",
    "80BD1EE4": "We found an elevator.",
    "80BD1EE6": "You’re good. Almost as good as Louis!",
    "80BD1EE8": "We’ll have to find another way up to Hawthorne.",
    "80BD1EEA": "Hey, Dev. I'm still sitting up here above the mines with this busted comm relay. Where's that signal booster?",
    "80BD1EEC": "Our new Guardian friend is en route. I'm getting too old to clean up after you, Suraya.",
    "80BD1EEE": "Finally! He admits he's old.",
    "80BD1EF0": "Hahaha! Bail me out on one assault charge and you never let me live it down.",
    "80BD1EF2": "Aww, don't you mean one a week? You're the reason my hair is gray.",
    "80BD1EF4": "Yeah, yeah. Keep talking, old man.",
    "80BD1F1C": "That elevator should take us to the top of the mines.",
    "80BD1F20": "Careful. The Fallen are scavengers of the highest order. They’re going to put up a fight for whatever they can get their grubby claws on.",
    "80BD1F22": "Ah! You’ll be pleased to know that I can see the Fallen fleeing the mine. Seems you’ve really kicked the hornet’s nest, haven’t you. ",
    "80BD1F24": "We're clear!",
    "80BD1F26": "Scratch that—we are not clear.",
    "80BD1F28": "Break another lift, did you? ",
    "80BD1F2A": "Not yet, but give 'em time.",
    "80BD1F54": "Hawthorne, we're out of the mine and heading your way.",
    "80BD1F56": "Then hurry up with that booster. Let's finish hooking up the comm network.",
    "80BD1F58": "And, uh, thanks for the help. You're not so bad for a fancy-pants Guardian.",
    "80BD1F5A": "Now that's the nicest thing I've ever heard Suraya say. You're in rarified air, my friend.",
    "80BD1F5C": "Hey, I’m right here! I can literally see you. Keep coming.",
    "80BD0DEE": "We’re almost to the hangar. ",
    "80BD0DF2": "By now, Thumos will know you’re coming for him. Expect a welcoming party in there.",
    "80BD0DF4": "Holliday, are you in range for an assist?",
    "80BD0DF6": "Swinging back around. Gotta shake a couple of these Red Uglies off my tail first!",
    "80BD1F5E": "All right, Guardian. I’ve done my part. Now go take care of Thumos for us. ",
    "80BD1F60": "You did a hell of a job, Guardian. I’m going to spread the word—ding, dong, Thumos is gone.",
    "80BD0DFC": "Here we go! We’re in the carrier.",
    "80BD0DFE": "Good. Your target is Thumos the Unbroken, one of Ghaul’s chosen. The key codes to his ship are your ticket to the Almighty. ",
    "80BD0E00": "Hawthorne had a run-in with him while you were off-planet. ",
    "80BD0E02": "They’re known as the Blood Guard for a reason. I’d tell you to be careful, but",
    "80BD0E04": "...that didn’t help the last team I sent out.",
    "80BD0E06": "Find the command deck, and you’ll find Thumos the Unbroken.",
    "80BD0E08": "And you’ll break him.",
    "80BD0E0E": "The bridge should be (beat) above us? (Beat) Let’s find a console and dig up the schematics. ",
    "80BD0E10": "Wish I could be out there with you. Pull the trigger myself.",
    "80BD0E12": "For my team.",
    "80BD0E14": "Your time will come, Hawthorne.",
    "80BD0E16": "I'm counting on it.",
    "80BD0E1C": "And this is what happens when you bring meat cleavers to a gun fight. Just saying.",
    "80BD0E1E": "Just try hopping on that ship. We do this all the time. ",
    "80BD1F62": "Don’t leave the door open if you don’t want me coming in!",
    "80BD0E22": "Checking the schematics Got it! Use that vent. It should lead us back to where we need to be.",
    "80BD0E24": "Someone order backup? ",
    "80BD0E26": "Haha! You better run!",
    "80BD0E28": "Back-up-back-up-back-up!",
    "80BD0E2A": "OK, I’ve got the map. Let’s find Thumos. ",
    "80BD1F98": "Whew! Got the key codes, and Thumos is dead. Check and check. ",
    "80BD1F9A": "Excellent work. Now get to the base, find his ship, and get to the Almighty. We’re counting on you.",
    "80BD1F9C": "You did a hell of a job, Guardian. I’m going to spread the word—Thumos is gone for good.",
    "80BD0E36": "Careful out there. The team I lost to Thumos—they were good people.  Some of my best. ",
    "80BD0E38": "Our Guardian can handle it, Hawthorne. It’s what we do. ",
    "80BD0E3A": "It’s what you did. Last I checked, without the Light—you and me? Not so different. ",
    "80BD0E3C": "The door is sealed!",
    "80BD0E3E": "Look around. There’s always another way in. ",
    "80BD0E73": "The Fallen were everywhere. Lord Saladin sent a regroup order to all channels. Zavala backed him. They weren't yelling, but it made my ears ring. Their exact words I can't remember. But Saladin and Zavala—their message was clear: all is lost. ",
    "80BD0E77": "Six of us took the Wall that day, against orders. One of us a Sunbreaker named Liu Feng. She wasn't even from the City. We died, and died, and died. But we had each other, and we had our Light. Six of us. The Wall held. Zavala and Lord Saladin made their counterattack.",
    "80BD0E79": "Some of the greatest Titans have defined the charge. Lord Shaxx. Saint-14. Wei Ning.",
    "80BD0E7B": "When my Ghost found me—when I was reborn as a Titan—she found me in a desert. I had died far from civilization, far from anything I could have possibly used to defend myself. ",
    "80BD0E7D": "I had the armor she made me, flimsy as it was, and a thousand miles to walk to get to what she said was my new home. Of course we ran into problems. ",
    "80BD0E7F": "The shamans of the old world were said to have covered their eyes so they could see the dead. I believe these men and women were the first to discover the power of Void, and in the Traveler's light we have succeeded in refining their methods, in charting the courses they pioneered.",
    "80BD0E81": "When you blink, you'll know the way.",
    "80BD0E83": "She leaves the rifle and walks across the naked obsidian into the swarm firing from the hip as she goes, each kick of the old revolver a word.",
    "80BD0E85": "The stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it, and the shrapnel guns throw up leaves of obsidian like glass butterflies.",
    "80BD0E87": "She shoots her bandoliers dry, and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth leap up to rush her with knives, but she raises her hand and burns them down with the golden gun, laughing.",
    "80BD1FB8": "I close my eyes and open my mouth. A breath. A storm. A song.",
    "80BD1FBA": "I blow a kiss for good luck on my Arcbolt Grenade and launch it at my foes. I launch a Thunderstrike and rain destruction from a distance. I call down a Stormtrance and sing my body electric.",
    "80BD1FBC": "Second verse: Perun, in shadow clad, behind the shield / through cleansing fire our hiding foes revealed.",
    "80BD1FD0": "Yours will be a difficult path—jagged, like lightning itself.",
    "80BD1FD2": "It is only the few who have the power to call down the storm. I’ve not often seen this talent from one so young.'`",
    "80BD1FD4": "I always knew that you were different from the others, but I never understood my unease. I'm afraid there is little left I can teach you.",
    "80BD1FD6": "'Quiet,' said the Voidwalkers. 'Louder!' said the Sunsingers. I tried to heed them both.",
    "80BD1FD8": "When I felt anger, I smothered it with shame; when I felt peaceful, I drowned it in guilt. And in so doing, disappointed everyone.",
    "80BD1FDA": "Then came the hurricane. First the rage, and then, the eye. And I realized I need not choose between the calm and the storm. Indeed, to have either, I must be both.",
    "80BD1FDC": "Deep breath. Exhale. Faintest breeze. In, out. a spark on the wind. Inhale. Hold it.",
    "80BD1FDE": "The air inside you is still. Quiet. A positive charge. A cloudless sky.",
    "80BD1FE0": "Now exhale all at once—aaaaah! A peal of thunder. Electric potential. A charge in the air.",
    "80BD1FE2": "Breathe in deep. Ozone burns your lungs. Hold it. With your next exhale comes the lightning. Hold it. Hold it.",
    "80BD1FE4": "Now!",
    "80BD0EA5": "Whew. Nicely done. Let's get out of here, I'm ready for a change of scenery.",
    "80BD0EA7": "Some Titan orders predate the City, born of a darker time, when Light was an untamed weapon.",
    "80BD0EA9": "The Sunbreakers brought honor to the wild, never seeking the safety of the City.",
    "80BD0EAB": "So Lord Saladin and Lady Efrideet. He'll hate that I'm telling this story. But Lady Efrideet—I like Lady Efrideet—she tells me everything. We like our stories, and we like our helmets. So Efrideet, she lifts Saladin over over her head. And she says She says, 'I never miss.'",
    "80BD0EAD": "She lifts him over her head, and she throws him. And he cranks his Fist of Havoc. Their combined Arc energy singing like a drawn sword! Twenty miles down he plummets. Into a Fallen Walker! He's like a like a cannon shot out of a friggin' anti-aircraft gun.",
    "80BD0EAF": "Everything explodes! Her Ghost was laughing when she revived him. They saved a whole village of people. This was the Dark Age. They had those. Villages. I miss those days. I miss Lady Efrideet.",
    "80BD0EB1": "With Strikers at the fore, the Red Legion cannot hope to stand against us. ",
    "80BD0EB3": "We are the Titans of the Last City. We are Strikers. And we will not be stopped.",
    "80BD0EB5": "Bound by an oath, they live as mercenaries, seeking battles and alliances beyond the Walls. Now the light of their fire has at last found rank among the City.",
    "80BD0EB7": "Forge the fury of undying suns. Wield the Hammer of Sol with honor, Titan. It is a thing of legend, both past and future.",
    "80BD0EB9": "'Think of how mysterious this system is,' I said. 'How much life sprang up when the Traveler came. Like the Ahamkara. Do you know the legends? The dragon that made promises?' And I pulled out the fossil with a flourish. ",
    "80BD0EBB": "She pulled out her knife and started to pick the dirt from her nails. That set me off. 'You could never have brought down one of these,' I said. 'Ever. Not the greatest Hunter, not the brawniest Titan.'",
    "80BD0EBD": "Her eyes narrowed. She said, 'Oh? Is that so?' And I saw right then that she wasn't going to pass on the challenge.",
    "80BD0EBF": "What is the Void? When you walk it, what is there to experience, as there is nothing to be seen in it?",
    "80BD0EC1": "The vacuum between the stars. The smell of rot. The taste of metal. The deafening roar that can only be heard when it is truly silent.",
    "80BD0EC3": "My old friend Andal—he used to stand right here, right in this spot—he'd come up with these wild stories. ",
    "80BD0EC5": "He'd say, 'You know, Cayde, I've been examining the evidence, and personally I've come to think it's you. You're Rasputin: legendary Warmind, defender of Earth.'",
    "80BD0EC7": "'And I wish you'd remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.' You can see how that'd be embarrassing.",
    "80BD0EC9": "I think these Light projections might be lessons.",
    "80BD0ECB": "Another Shard of the Traveler! But we're not alone.",
    "80BD0ECD": "Over there. Another projection.",
    "80BD1FE6": "The noble man stood. And the people looked to him. For he was a beacon—hope given form, yet still only a man. ",
    "80BD1FE8": "And within that truth there was great promise. If one man could stand against the night, then so too could anyone. So too could everyone. ",
    "80BD1FEA": "In his strong hand, the man held a rose. And his aura burned bright.",
    "80BD1FEC": "I looked at her and wondered how many innocent lives she'd ended on those broken blades. She did the strangest thing then. She took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it.",
    "80BD1FEE": "When I went to pick it up, she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and yeah—I did what I had to do.",
    "80BD1FF0": "To this day, I wonder if she hated me or wanted to make me kill her—or just felt she should spare me the choice.",
    "80BD0EDB": "There's the Shard. Wait. Did you hear that? Taken, inbound! ",
    "80BD0EDD": "You ready for weird storytime? I'm ready for weird storytime.",
    "80BD0EDF": "Zavala likes to say that survival is a temporary condition. To fight for it, always. But survival is already owed to us. The Collapse has come and gone, and yet here we stand. It is our nature to survive, whether we like it or not.",
    "80BD0EE1": "Guardians ask me, 'What should we fight for?'",
    "80BD0EE3": "How about peace? How about a City without fear?",
    "80BD0EE5": "Hey, we've got company!",
    "80BD0EE7": "This Shard called us here. I'm sure of it.",
    "80BD0EE9": "But you will not be held back. Gifted with the Traveler's Light, armed with the secret physics of a lost age, you will tear reality asunder. You will fear nothing, and nothing will not fear you.",
    "80BD0EEB": "Gotta love the ambiance... Hey! Do you see that? Over there. The light.",
    "80BD0EED": "You a Guardian of the Last City. You are the hope for humanity.",
    "80BD0EEF": "Some doctrines argue that the role of a Titan is to stand in defense of the City. The Strikers see a crackling offense as the best defense.",
    "80BD0EF1": "Strikers throw their bodies at incoming fire so others won't have to. It's also the most direct line to a target.",
    "80BD0EF3": "Because, you see, when a Striker turns her entire body into a projectile, no one is truly safe. And at close quarters, a fist is better than any gun.",
    "80BD0EF5": "So I say what I want to say every day—it's no secret—I say, 'Well, I'll go find it, then. I'll go tell Rasputin we need its help.'",
    "80BD0EF7": "And Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that—you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, 'Wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you?' One of those looks.",
    "80BD0EF9": "She says, 'Cayde, the problem isn't just that we can't find Rasputin. The problem is it's not clear to any of us that Rasputin wants to be found.'",
    "80BD1FF2": "It's very simple. You reach into the Void—past visions of your own death and the extinction of life, past fears and nightmares—and take what you find.",
    "80BD1FF4": "I don't know why every Hunter doesn't do it.",
    "80BD0EFF": "Incredible. If that was a test, I think we aced it.",
    "80BD0F01": "Heads up! Fallen!",
    "80BD0F03": "That Shard must have a little Light left to give.",
    "80BD0F05": "The Traveler came out of the void that surrounds all things. Thus we know that the void is full of power. Thus we enter the void without fear.",
    "80BD0F07": "Small minds will call your abilities blasphemous. They will compare you to the abominable Wizards of the Hive.",
    "80BD0F09": "How do I know the Sunbreakers?",
    "80BD0F0B": "I fought with them at the pinnacle of the Wall. Shoulder to shoulder. They died right alongside us that day for a City they felt had abandoned them. I admired that. Never thought I would see the Light of their hammers in the City again. But that Guardian. That Guardian always surprises me.",
    "80BD0F0D": "I admired that. Never thought I would see the Light of their hammers in the City again. But that Guardian. That Guardian always surprises me.",
    "80BD0F0F": "This is the shape and the point of the tooth: nothing has ever lived that will not die. Now I fly between green-black suns in the labyrinth beyond Crota’s god-star.",
    "80BD0F11": "This is the Overworld, the Sea of Screams, where the throne-universes of the great Hive fester in eternal majesty. ",
    "80BD0F13": "I move among them. I map the shapes and connections of this world.",
    "80BD0F15": "The Shard gave us a gift. Let's use it!",
    "80BD0F17": "What's it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, and those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin's mind, I wonder, 'What would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?'",
    "80BD0F19": "Because I was a servant too. I was an instrument of war, bound to the will of a lesser master. But I learned to be something more...",
    "80BD0F1B": "This forest again... Well, I can't say our last visit wasn't memorable. Let's see what we can find.",
    "80BD0F1D": "This forest is like a black hole. It just keeps pulling us back in. But I suppose good things keep happening here... somehow...",
    "80BD1FF6": "You take aim before you pull the bow. That's right, it doesn't make sense. It's the void. So you take aim, in the middle of a firefight. You line up your shot. Then, you pull the bow. Always worth it for the looks on their faces.",
    "80BD1FF8": "It's all about where you belong. Warlocks have their libraries. Titans have their walls. Hunters belong in the wilds. And there ain't nobody as wild as a Hunter with a fistful of void.",
    "80BD0F23": "I don't know why the Traveler keeps choosing to grant us its powers. There must be others like us out there, fighting for what's right.",
    "80BD1FFA": "You are a conduit.'`Between sky and earth.'`Electricity and matter.'`Life and death.",
    "80BD1FFC": " You are a weapon. You must have harmony within to be a hurricane without.",
    "80BD0F29": "I'm picking up Fallen radio chatter. They're calling reinforcements!",
    "80BD0F2B": "I'm sure the Traveler called us to the forest deliberately. It's amazing that even a corrupted Shard can still do so much good.",
    "80BD0F2D": "Whoa! Um. Knock knock?",
    "80BD0F2F": "As a Titan, you lead the charge. You are the first into the fray. ",
    "80BD0F31": "The body is made from tiny stuff, from near-nothings. From atoms swimming through a blood of crackling sparks.",
    "80BD0F33": "Simple, eternal laws shape the universe. The largest galaxy is ruled by principles of mass and motion. Electrons are slaves to charge and to chance. And this is why the universe feels inexhaustible, eternal. ",
    "80BD0F35": "The Light allows us to master charge and chance. Wielding Arc energy in their fists, Strikers become the roar of thunder, the crash of lightning.",
    "80BD0F37": "All I can think is, 'If Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost, what did it learn?'",
    "80BD0F39": "I see you haven't changed much, portal. Still... huge and scary...",
    "80BD0F3B": "I hear the roar before I see him, but when I look up, I can make out a blue burst against the skyline. When he falls, he brings the sky with him. ",
    "80BD0F3D": "He scatters me and my squad to the wind. Leaves us dead as the moment our Ghosts found us. They bring us back, and he helps us up. Then he says one thing. ",
    "80BD0F3F": "He said 'Tell me what you’ve learned.'",
    "80BD1FFE": "As a Warlock, you are the unleashed storm. You are power unleashed.",
    "80BF4000": "Focus.'`The Arc is inside all life. Feel it take hold. Let it flow through, but not consume you. ",
    "80BF4002": "You hear that from some Warlock? No, no, no. The void ain't special. It sure is creepier than solar or arc, that's for sure. But it isn't special. Just show it respect, thank it for a lovely evening, and make sure you always pay your bill. So to speak. Then you've got nothing to worry about.",
    "80BD0F47": "The Taken will do anything to stop us from leaving. ",
    "80BD0F49": "I want to appear in the Tower and taunt them. Lo, lo, I never sleep. I dance in light and shadow. I never sleep. I will never die. ",
    "80BD0F4B": "I will never die. I want to ask them: if you followed your laws here, to this trembling fearful place, of what use were those laws?",
    "80BD0F4D": "But I have work to do. I shout into deep places. 'Osiris!' I call. 'Osiris, Osiris! Can you hear me?'",
    "80BD0F4F": "Bandits, first, with guns scavenged from who knows where. My second death was terrifying. But I got back up, and the night sky sparkled overhead, and the man that killed me stared aghast, and I laughed. Immortal! Me! I could do anything!",
    "80BD0F51": "So I threw myself at him. If my body couldn't be broken, then that was my greatest weapon, greater than any gun that could jam or knife that could dull. Each punch and charge and kick would only sharpen my skills.",
    "80BD0F53": "I taught the Strikers this truth. The fastest and surest way to a Guardian's victory is to rush headlong into that danger. Be unafraid. You are the lightning, and the thunder after it.",
    "80BD0F55": "Let's show the Taken what you've learned.",
    "80BD0F89": "If Hawthorne hadn't been out there in the wilds, on the lookout for people escaping the City  well. I'm glad we met her. Who knows where we'd be now?",
    "80BD0F8D": "Look at this. I've heard some of the civilians talk about settling down out here once the fighting stops. I'm not sure that's such a good idea but  you can't argue with the view.",
    "80BD0F8F": "A Shard of the Traveler. I can't find any record of why it's here, or how it got here. We're a long way from the City, you know. I want to believe it's here for a reason. For us.",
    "80BD0F9B": "Devrim spent years defending the City from places just like this along the Wall. I can see why he found this spot comforting.",
    "80BF4004": "Of course the Red Legion have tanks too. ",
    "80BF4006": "We need to take both generators out to drop the shield. ",
    "80BF4008": "Heads up! That carrier’s spinning up its engines. You might want to pick up the pace!",
    "80BF400A": "Thumos is on that carrier. He has what you need to infiltrate the Almighty. MOVE! ",
    "80BF400C": "We’re almost out of the tunnels and coming up on the carrier.",
    "80BF400E": "Good. The only thing standing between you and the Almighty is Thumos the Unbroken. ",
    "80BF4010": "He’s a Blood Guard. One of Ghaul’s 'chosen.' The Red Legion will die for him.",
    "80BF4012": "Why don’t you help them with that?  ",
    "80BD0F91": "Heads up!",
    "80BD0F93": "Say hello to the 'Drake'.",
    "80BD0F95": "You might recognize this beauty from your near-death experience in the Arcology",
    "80BD0F97": "What could have done THAT to a Walker?",
    "80BD0F99": "Hawthorne said the Fallen tried pushing into the base. Guess the base pushed back. ",
    "80BF4014": "Wait—see those generators? We need to take them out if we’re going to board that carrier.",
    "80BF4016": "We should find the controls for that blast door. They’re around here somewhere.",
    "80BF4018": "The carrier’s grounded. Now let’s find Thumos.",
    "80BF401A": "Good work, Guardian. ",
    "80BF401C": "And Cayde after this is over, I’ll talk to Holliday about your tank. ",
    "80BF401E": "Aw I missed you too, buddy.",
    "80BD0FB7": "So, Zavala, I gotta ask you something. When you told our Guardian friend here, and I quote, 'I need Cayde,' did you by any chance happen to maybe cry? ",
    "80BD0FB9": "Ahem. Holliday. What’s your status? ",
    "80BD0FBB": "Let the record show: no denial.",
    "80BD0FBD": "Still a couple clicks out, Commander. This girl’s heavy! ",
    "80BF4020": "One generator down.",
    "80BF4022": "Guardian: holler my way if you need another one of these armored beauties. Plenty more where that came from.",
    "80BF4024": "Oh so I get nothing, and they get as many as they want. I see how it is.  ",
    "80BF4026": "They’re shielding the carrier! ",
    "80BD0FCB": "Guardian. You got a tough road ahead. So I’m sending in Holliday with something special. ",
    "80BD0FCD": "Are we talking Gjallarhorn special? Or an Ikora philosophy lesson special? ",
    "80BD0FCF": "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa—how special are we talking here?",
    "80BD0FD1": "Just keep moving. Storm the facility and board that Cabal Carrier. No matter the cost—we MUST get to the Almighty. ",
    "80BD0FD5": "You got us a TANK?!",
    "80BD0FD7": "You got them a TANK? How come I never got a tank?",
    "80BD0FD9": "You know you’d just break it.",
    "80BF4028": "That should give us a way across.",
    "80BF402A": "So, if it wasn’t to give me a tank—why did you send our favorite Guardian to find me?",
    "80BF4111": "Your high-risk, high-reward combat maneuvers can be effective and inspirational. ",
    "80BF4115": "Well yeah, but with a tank they could be like a million times MORE inspirational! ",
    "80BF4117": "Well. They’ve retracted the bridge. We’re not going to be able to cross that gap.",
    "80BF4119": "Oh, your super tank can’t fly? Oh",
    "80BF411B": "Shield’s down, but the ship’s about to launch without us! ",
    "80BF411D": "Keep that carrier on the ground! ",
    "80BF411F": "Couple missiles up its tailpipe ought to do the job. ",
    "80BF4121": "There’s probably a way to extend the bridge. Let’s find the control room. ",
    "80BF4123": "Don’t think we’re going to be able to shoot our way through that door. The override should be nearby. ",
    "80BF4125": "I FEEL LIKE YOU’RE NOT HEARING ME. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR THE DOOR CONTROLS.",
    "80BF4128": "The way’s clear, now let me at Thumos’s ship.",
    "80BF412A": "Great! This is the part where you 'borrow' it.",
    "80BF412C": "Like when you 'borrowed' Eris's ship? She will want a replacement, Cayde.",
    "80BF412E": "Eris loves me. She'll be fine.",
    "80BD103D": "Thumos, the Unbroken has a ship in that base.",
    "80BD103E": "It's the only way we can get you onto the Almighty undetected.",
    "80BD103F": "So you're going to steal it. ",
    "80BD1040": "News flash, folks: the Fallen are on the move. Seems they didn't learn their lesson the first time.",
    "80BD1041": "Those scavenging vultures, those Fallen. Always turn up when you don’t want them. Kinda like a Warlock when you’re uh",
    "80BD1042": "Go on.",
    "80BD1043": "I think—no—I'm I’m done.",
    "80BF4188": "There's only one ship left on the landing pads.",
    "80BF418A": "That must be Thumos's ship. Get to it before it's too late!",
    "80BF418C": "I don’t hear dying! Still in one piece?",
    "80BF418E": "Unlike someone I know, they can handle hostile technology.",
    "80BF4190": "Hey! That teleporter was all Vex-y and stuff.",
    "80BF4192": "The key codes work! Finish them off and get on board! ",
    "80BF4194": "Cover me. I need to figure out how this works.",
    "80BF4196": "Protect that ship!",
    "80BF480E": "Hey, team? We've found a Taken Blight. It's doing all kinds of crazy things to the water and the soil.",
    "80BF4814": "They haven't been this aggressive since the Dreadnaught menaced the system. Since Oryx. Be ready for anything.",
    "80BD10B6": "One of my teams reported Taken energy infecting the water supply. Our purification tech can only do so much. If the contamination spreads, people will die.",
    "80BF4832": "This is the most ambitious Taken operation since Oryx led their charge.",
    "80BF4858": "The former Taken King?",
    "80BF486E": "Yes. Ikora has mentioned he has sisters.",
    "80BF4871": "I'll bet they're as monstrous as he is. We'll box their ears, too.",
    "80BF4874": "This place is old; good thing we can't get tetanus.",
    "80BF48EA": "This facility provided water for many generations.",
    "80BF48EE": "If for nothing else but principle, I'm glad you're reclaiming it.",
    "80BF48F0": "If the Taken wanted to poison the entire Dead Zone, this was the place to do it. They didn't pick it by accident.",
    "80BF48F2": "If they succeed, we won't have room on the Farm. We're still treating wounded from the Red War.",
    "80BF48F4": "It won't come to that.",
    "80BF48F6": "Gah. Do they think this is funny?",
    "80BF48F8": "Where did that come from?",
    "80BF48FA": "Let's push them back.",
    "80BF48FC": "Why?",
    "80BF4A9E": "Uh-oh.",
    "80BF4AA1": "Oh, no.",
    "80BF4900": "I don't like this.",
    "80BF4902": "Okay. That's not funny.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Stop!",
    "80BF4904": "If I had arms, I'd punch a Taken.",
    "80BF4906": "This looks...much worse than I was imagining.",
    "80BF4908": "They just left that unguarded...? This smells fishy to me.",
    "80BF490A": "Taken energy is spiking. This is it.",
    "80BD10D3": "All the muck cleared up. The soil and water seem fine, now...",
    "80BD10D4": "Then we know how to beat this. The Blights have to go.",
    "80BD10D5": "The Taken fog cleared up as soon as that Blight went down...",
    "80BD10D6": "If the Blights can be killed, then perhaps their infection can be reversed! You lot are going to save lives today.",
    "80BD10D7": "Destroying the Blight destroyed the Taken miasma. This area's no longer infected.",
    "80BD10D8": "Good work. There's bound to be more than one.",
    "80BD10D9": "Killing that Blight returned the soil and water readings to normal.",
    "80BD10DA": "Let's hope there aren't lasting effects. Take them out, please.",
    "80BF4914": "We've run into a massive Taken sphere. It might have been a Blight once, but it's nowhere near as vulnerable. I don't think we have the firepower to destroy it.",
    "80BF4916": "It looks like one of the horrors you encountered on the Dreadnaught. You'll beat this like you beat Oryx.",
    "80BF4918": "Okay, what is this? It's like the normal Blights but with a hardened outer shell. Impenetrable.",
    "80BF491A": "That was the first thing the scout teams ran into out here. I'm assuming that's the endgame for the Taken.",
    "80BF491C": "Full dark.",
    "80BF491E": "This thing has the properties of a Blight, but... my readings say it's so dense it can't be destroyed.",
    "80BF4923": "Makes sense to me. Ikora said the Taken are made by subtraction. How do you destroy a vacuum?",
    "80BF492B": "Perhaps you're looking at their endgame. A universe filled with emptiness.",
    "80BF492D": "Interesting notion. When this threat is ended, I'd like to mull it over with you.",
    "80BD10E4": "Operation Stormcoat is ready for action. Scouts have reported a sudden change in Taken behavior in the EDZ.",
    "80BD10E5": "Quite. They are collaborating. Moving together with purpose, like a proper marching unit. ",
    "80BD10E6": "I want to know if this has to do with the Taken activity that Ikora has reported on the moon Io.",
    "80BD10E7": "Bad news if the Taken crown a new king. We'll have a look around.",
    "80BD10E8": "You're here. Then Operation Stormcoat can begin. A local band of Taken has holed up in a neighboring hydro plant.",
    "80BD10E9": "They seem rather fond of it. At this rate, I'll have Taken muck in my tea by day's end.",
    "80BD10EA": "How could they have coordinated this well? The Taken have no leader....",
    "80BD10EB": "Perhaps you just answered your own question, Ghost.",
    "80BD10EC": "Welcome to Operation Stormcoat, Guardian. The Taken run rampant out here, even without their king to lead them.",
    "80BD10ED": "They've occupied a water processing plant nearby, and their very presence is poisoning the environment.",
    "80BD10EE": "We need you to confirm what they're doing. Evaluate and neutralize.",
    "80BD10EF": "Oh, yeah. Environmental damage. Bad for you squishy types.",
    "80BD10F0": "Mobilizing fireteam for Operation, uh Babydog? Why does this say 'Babydog?' I must have forgotten to reboot the strike name generator",
    "80BD10F1": "Operation 'Babydog?' Well, it has a certain ring to it, huh?",
    "80BD10F2": "Yes... 'Babydog.' Well, the strike protocol is already running. Can't stop it now. Devrim?  ",
    "80BD10F3": "Yes, sorry. Fireteam 'Babydog' the Taken are polluting the EDZ. We need to determine the source of—Haha!—I'm sorry, I can't Stand-by, fireteam.",
    "80BD10F4": "Guardian. You’re here. Excellent. Devrim, are you linked up?",
    "80BD10F5": "I am.",
    "80BD10F6": "Good to hear your voice. Operation Stormcoat is go.",
    "80BD10F7": "Devrim and the Commander on the same feed? More like Operation Easy Listening.",
    "80BD10F8": "Get off this line, Holliday! Ahem. This mission moves at your discretion, Guardian.",
    "80BD10F9": "Hawthorne's scouts tracked a group of Fallen to a hydroelectric plant nearby. A plant that was already infested with Taken.",
    "80BD10FA": "These Taken are surprisingly well-coordinated. We couldn't get close.",
    "80BD10FB": "Forget the Fallen. The Taken may have a new leader. They've learned defensive tactics and territory control almost overnight.",
    "80BD10FC": "We'll see what we can do.",
    "80BD10FD": "The Taken have occupied an old water facility near your location. Not to be outdone, the Fallen are attempting to seize it from them by force.",
    "80BD10FE": "The Fallen are an afterthought. Whatever the Taken are doing here, they are contaminating the water supply. You don't want to see the pot of tea I made this morning.",
    "80BD10FF": "Civilians are depending on you. Operation Stormcoat has begun.",
    "80BD1100": "Welcome to Operation Stormcoat, Guardian. The Taken have deployed shielded Blights and other defensive measures across this area. The local hydro plant is under their control.",
    "80BD1101": "Their behavior here has been almost militaristic. ",
    "80BD1102": "Watch out for Fallen, as well. They get their arms in everything, don't they? It appears we're not the only ones with interests in this region.",
    "80BD1103": "We're making good progress, but Taken energy readings are still off the charts.",
    "80BD1104": "There must be a source. The Cabal hurt us, Guardian, but the Taken could ruin the EDZ forever. Put an end to this.",
    "80BD1105": "I'm still tracking Taken energy nearby. They're all over the water facility. And... under it?",
    "80BD1106": "Whatever's behind this must be underground.",
    "80BD1107": "Every Taken energy source on the surface is dead. Plenty more underneath us, though.",
    "80BD1108": "You're fighting symptoms. They have to have a source. A leader guiding their will.",
    "80BF496A": "Zavala, the Taken leader is down for the count. Surprise of the day: he was Red Legion.",
    "80BF496C": "Impossible Oryx is long dead. There's no one left to take.",
    "80BF496E": "Ikora was telling me about a Hive tome called the Book of Sorrows. That Oryx has sisters.",
    "80BF4970": "You both dealt with the Taken on Io. I'll consult her about this. In the meantime, excellent work. All of you.",
    "80BF4972": "We killed the guy in charge and his big, scary Blight.",
    "80BF4974": "The scouts I sent are the best in the militia, and even they were ultimately helpless against this. You Guardians are a blessing.",
    "80BF4976": "When we have a common goal, civilians and Guardians can stand side by side and accomplish anything.",
    "80BF4978": "I could listen to you two talk all day.",
    "80BF497A": "The Taken compromised a Red Legionary. It would explain how organized they've been. Without Oryx, I didn't think they could still, well... Take.",
    "80BF497C": "Ikora and I will investigate. Meanwhile, contamination is clearing across the region.",
    "80BF497E": "The Fallen are chattering about this on every feed. As much as I hate to admit it, we have a common goal when it comes to protecting this place. It's their home, too.",
    "80BF4983": "Guardian, there's an arsenal ketch on its way. Do what you do best?",
    "80BF4985": "To those in the field: A ketch is on its way. I'm not sure what it's up to, but I doubt it's good.",
    "80BF4987": "Come along and say hello when you can! I'll have the tea on.",
    "80BF4989": "We got those Walkers! And the scorch cannons! We got everything!",
    "80BF498B": "You are indeed a force of nature.",
    "80BF498D": "Ha, we stomped two Walkers and took their caches!",
    "80BF498F": "Superlative work!",
    "80BF4991": "I'm still seeing the heat signatures of heavy weapons on that ship. No worries, there'll be a next time.",
    "80BF4993": "Our target ketch is on the way out. You keep them on their toes. Much appreciated.",
    "80BF4995": "How nice of the Fallen to share their caches with us.",
    "80BF4997": "Let's see them fight without weapons. (beat) Wait",
    "80BF4999": "The Fallen and their stockpiles. Will they ever learn?",
    "80BF499B": "I certainly hope they don't!",
    "80BF499D": "This is about to get interesting.",
    "80BF499F": "And very dangerous. Watch out.",
    "80BF49A1": "We did some damage!",
    "80BF49A3": "It'll cost them time and resources to fix that. Then they'll be back.",
    "80BF49A5": "Look at them run! They weren't expecting that.",
    "80BF49A7": "Good show. But I have a feeling they'll be back.",
    "80BF49A9": "Got that Walker! We wrecked it!",
    "80BF49AB": "An ace job. I couldn't ask for more.",
    "80BF49AD": "We brought that Walker to its knees!",
    "80BF49AF": "I thought I heard an explosion?",
    "80BF49B1": "Yeah, because then we blew it up!",
    "80BF49B3": "Impressive.",
    "80BF49B5": "Yeah, we stole your weapons again! What are you going to do about it?",
    "80BF49B7": "To judge by past experience, nothing. Well done.",
    "80BF49B9": "We sent them home empty-handed! No cannons, and one Walker short.",
    "80BF49BB": "Thanks to you, the Fallen are having a very bad day.",
    "80BF49BD": "You've had better days. And you will have more of them.",
    "80BD1163": "They got away.",
    "80BF49BF": "I'm sure you put some bullets into that lander! You'll get them next time.",
    "80BF49C1": "Hey, Devrim, guess what? The Cabal lost everything. And I mean EVERYTHING.",
    "80BF49C3": "Yet another devastating blow to their morale. Brilliant!",
    "80BF49C5": "I heard those explosions from here. What was that?",
    "80BF49C7": "Oh, just us taking out a mining lander, a ship, and a Commander.",
    "80BF49C9": "As you do. I stand in awe.",
    "80BF49CB": "They sacrificed another lander.",
    "80BF49CD": "Ahh. I knew I could count on you to make my day.",
    "80BF49CF": "They blew up their own drill, Devrim.",
    "80BF49D1": "Then you must have been quite intimidating! Well done.",
    "80BF49D3": "You're quite intriguing for a stranger in the wilds. Do drop by.",
    "80BD117B": "Well, that solves that.",
    "80BF49D5": "A complete override. The lander's ours. Now what do we do with it?",
    "80BD117F": "Ship down!",
    "80BF49D7": "We got that ship! That's a black eye for them!",
    "80BF49D9": "I've spotted another Cabal mining expedition. Guardian, you know the drill.",
    "80BF49DB": "The Cabal are bringing in a fortified mining lander. I believe this means a resource grab. ",
    "80BF49DD": "Ha! The big guy came down, took one look at us, and ran away!",
    "80BF49DF": "They must recognize you by now. What a terror you are!",
    "80BF49E1": "They're retreating! I don't think they'll come back in a hurry.",
    "80BF49E3": "With all the embarrassment you've caused them, I believe it! Good work.",
    "80BF49E5": "There they go again! Can't stand and face us, huh?",
    "80BF49E7": "I can't blame them. You are formidable.",
    "80BF49E9": "Yeah, that's right, get out of here!",
    "80BF49EB": "The old cut and run, eh? An enviable outcome.",
    "80BF49ED": "If we hang on long enough, this lander is ours!",
    "80BF49EF": "Do as you see fit. I trust your methods.",
    "80BD119B": "Hey, you! Clear out!",
    "80BF49F1": "I'd expect a Cabal mining expedition to be heavily armed. Be careful.",
    "80BF49FF": "Ether Servitor en route to reinforce the line. I trust your expertise.",
    "80BF4A01": "To all Guardians by the Cabal base: There's an Ether Ketch headed your way.",
    "80BF4A03": "It's panicking. Right on schedule.",
    "80BF4A05": "It's going haywire!",
    "80BF4A07": "The Fallen are at it again.",
    "80BF4A09": "Keep them hungry.",
    "80BF4A0B": "Look at those Fallen, acting like they own this place!",
    "80BF4A0D": "Take down that Servitor and they starve.",
    "80BF4A0F": "Ether drop incoming, Guardian. You've seen this before.",
    "80BF4A11": "All forces in the field: A Ketch has been reported en route to an Ether drop.",
    "80BF4A13": "Come by when you can, Guardian. None of us should be strangers here.",
    "80BF4A15": "Servitor down, Ether gone, a whole crew sacrificed... The Fallen are having a very bad day.",
    "80BF4A17": "I expected nothing less from you.",
    "80BF4A19": "We got the Servitor! And the Servitor took down the other Fallen!",
    "80BF4A1B": "You've smashed their hopes to powder again. Excellent!",
    "80BF4A1D": "Another Servitor for the junk pile!",
    "80BF4A1F": "I never tire of hearing that. Thank you, Guardian.",
    "80BF4A21": "We finished off that Servitor!",
    "80BF4A23": "They were counting on those supplies. Well done.",
    "80BF4A25": "Your heart wasn't in it, Guardian. No matter.",
    "80BF4A27": "Your distraction helped. Any Ether wasted is good for us.",
    "80BF4A29": "They're leaving!",
    "80BF4A2B": "Any Ether lost is good. But I've seen you break Servitors. I know what you can do.",
    "80BF4A2D": "That's right, get out of here!",
    "80BF4A2F": "You've denied them a lot of Ether and thinned their ranks. My thanks to you.",
    "80BF4A31": "Servitor's gone, bu-u-ut... it took out the Fallen along the way.",
    "80BF4A33": "A heavy blow to that crew. Well done!",
    "80BF4A35": "That's a lot of Fallen gone! Their Servitor sacrificed them!",
    "80BF4A37": "That news will spread far and fast. My congratulations, Guardian.",
    "80BF4A53": "And that's the end of that!",
    "80BF4A55": "Crash, bang, boom. That is the kind of music I like best. Thank you again, Guardian.",
    "80BF4A57": "Do I hear an Injection Rig exploding?",
    "80BF4A59": "Good guess!",
    "80BF4A5B": "You made them regret ever coming here. Sending you what I can, as thanks.",
    "80BF4A5D": "We should meet, Guardian. Come over, we'll make you dinner sometime, play a card game, eh?",
    "80BF4A5F": "Let's do this.",
    "80BF4A61": "Hit them where it hurts.",
    "80BF4A63": "Let's chase them out.",
    "80BF4A75": "They think they will spy on my territory. Hmph.",
    "80BF4A77": "How was that, Devrim?",
    "80BF4A79": "I've seen you crush the Cabal. Today you stepped on them. That is good. I have seen you do great.",
    "80BF4A7B": "Look at them go! Can't stand and face us, huh?",
    "80BF4A7D": "They've collected far less information than they wanted, thanks to you.",
    "80BF4A7F": "Injection Rig approaching, Guardian. You know what to do.",
    "80BF4A81": "All forces in the field: We have sightings of Red Legion Infiltrators on their way.",
    "80BF4A83": "We blew up the Rig again, Devrim!",
    "80BF4A85": "You know what I say about you, Guardian? You do things big, and you do them with style.",
    "80BF4A87": "We did it!!",
    "80BF4A8B": "The distant detonations tell me you've been exceptionally resourceful. I look forward to hearing the whole story.",
    "80BF4A8D": "That's all the vents. Here we go",
    "80BF4A8F": "The vents are blown. It won't get away.",
    "80BF4A91": "I know your potential, Guardian. I've seen you achieve amazing feats.",
    "80BF4A93": "They've fled. Thank you for the help.",
    "80BF4A95": "So long, Cabal!",
    "80BF4A97": "Excellent work, as always. You remind me of myself, when I was—ahh, I've gone soft. Never mind.",
    "80BF4A99": "Yeah, get your Rig out of here!",
    "80BF4A9B": "Do I see the Cabal fleeing with tails tucked? Well done.",
    "80BF4ABA": "Ah. Just the person to resolve this.",
    "80BF4ABC": "You think before you act. Uncommon, among Guardians.",
    "80BF4AC0": "Got something for you.",
    "80BF4AC2": "We will accomplish much together, you and I. If you ever leave the church.",
    "80BF4AC4": "You've earned this, my friend.",
    "80BF4AC6": "For work well done, of course.",
    "80BF4AC8": "You've done it.",
    "80BF4ACA": "We must speak of a serious matter.",
    "80BF4ACC": "I have a problem that needs to be sorted.",
    "80BF4AEC": "If you've the time and inclination, I have a job for you.",
    "80BF4AEE": "I'm concerned about an issue in the field.",
    "80BF4AF8": "There is something pressing, a challenge for you. ",
    "80BF4AFA": "I've got something for you. I think you'll find it fun.",
    "80BD1294": "I cannot afford to be distracted. I hope you understand.",
    "80BF4AFC": "The strong, stoic type, eh?",
    "80BF4AFE": "Considering your next action, are you?",
    "80BF4B00": "I do hope you intend to move at some point in the near future",
    "80FF54B2": "Lost in thought, are we Guardian? The secrets of the universe are vast. I'd imagine a lot of them are in that head of yours.",
    "80FF54B3": "These days I find myself preferring the stillness of the Farm. I wonder if I'll make it home to the City after all.",
    "80FF54B4": "Places like the Farm are rare, but necessary. If humanity is to rediscover our place across this earth, we must put down new roots.",
    "80FF54B5": "I spent a lot of time defending the City. I love it with all my heart. But so do many others. They will take care of it just the same.",
    "80FF54B6": "Suraya would never let me hear the end of it if I told her I'd like to stay on the Farm after all.",
    "80FF54B7": "Marc and the kids have moved out to the Farm. It's probably temporary, but we like the peace and quiet.",
    "80FF54B8": "Did you forget your business? I have had that problem as well.",
    "80FF54BA": "Your dedication to stillness is admirable.",
    "80FF54BC": "Hawthorne and I are much alike. We would be, after all the years we have known each other. But I believe in the dream of the City. I will return home.",
    "80FF54BE": "I have patrolled the Walls for much of my life, Guardian. To be so far beyond their protection is strange. It is so open out here  and so very dangerous.",
    "80FF54C0": "I've known Hawthorne since before she picked up her first rifle. Even then, I knew. The way her face lit up when I told stories from the Wall. I  knew she'd be something special.",
    "80FF54C2": "The milita  it is not sanctioned by the Vanguard. Did you know that? They do not feel comfortable with fragile, delicate humanity having a hand in its own protection.",
    "80FF54C4": "Do you know what I miss the most? Marc has mastered the art of the perfect cup of tea. He knows just how I like it, too. There was always a cup waiting when I got home.",
    "80FF54C6": "Patrolling the walls, you get to know the Fallen. They've done their very damndest to kill us and take the Traveler. And now look at them -- they've torn themselves apart trying to survive. It's almost a pity.",
    "80FF54C8": "You must be still, inside, to be a sniper. It took years to steady the shakes. Hehe. I hope I have a few more years yet before they come back.",
    "80FF54CA": "In the militia, I quite enjoyed standing on the walls, looking out at the big wide world beyond. Never thought I'd actually be in that world, mind. That's where Hawthorne and I differed.",
    "80FF54CC": "Some of your fellow Guardians seem very surprised 'mere mortals' can accomplish so much without the Light. They should spend more time in the City, I think.",
    "80FF54CE": "I will go home again. I will sleep in my bed. Drink my tea. Stand upon the walls, and look up at the Traveler. That City is ours. And we will not let them keep it.",
    "80FF54D0": "I have seen many strange things on the Walls, over the years. You Guardians account for much of that. Rocket launchers  are not toys.",
    "80FF54D2": "Looking back, it makes perfect sense that Hawthorne made friends with a bird. She was a very strange child.",
    "80FF54D4": "Yes  Hawthorne. I think one of the Guardians has broken. Send a repair crew.",
    "80FF54D6": "Happy Crimson Days, Guardian! Nothing better than fighting alongside the people you love.",
    "80FF54D7": "In the City Watch, us normal soldiers held a sort of Crimson Days celebration of our own. Though with far less dying, of course.",
    "80FF54D8": "This year, I'll be building Suraya a brand new rifle with her name engraved on it. She won't forget this Dawning.",
    "80FF54D9": "Suraya is quite the gift-giver. Last Dawning, she gave me one hundred pounds of dried weasel jerky. How thoughtful.",
    "80FF54DA": "Was Cayde frustrating? At times. But it was part of his charm. A loveable fool. And quite the shot to boot.",
    "80FF54DB": "There was a memorial for Cayde down at the Farm recently. Suraya organized it.",
    "80FF54DC": "Suraya didn't take Cayde's death very well. She won't talk about it. Just carries on as before. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned.",
    "80FF54DD": "So Zavala refused to help you with the Barons? Somehow that doesn't surprise me.",
    "80FF54DE": "Personal motives aside, the Reef is better off for what you did there.",
    "80FF54DF": "Do you have more business back on the Reef?",
    "80FF54E0": "The Awoken have always fascinated me. Where they came from, where they live.",
    "80FF54E1": "I'd love to hear all about the Dreaming City if you've got the time, Guardian.",
    "80FF54E2": "I suppose you'll be returning to the Dreaming City soon, huh?",
    "80FF54E3": "Don't be shy. I don't bite.",
    "80FF54E4": "Come, enjoy the view with me.",
    "80FF54E5": "You're here. Very good.",
    "80FF54E6": "I've been hoping to see you again.",
    "80FF54E7": "Always nice to see a familiar face.",
    "80FF54E8": "What was that?",
    "80FF54EA": "Guardian!",
    "80FF54EC": "Yes?",
    "80FF54EE": "Hello there.",
    "80FF54F0": "Ah, hello.",
    "80FF54F2": "Any Guardian would be lucky to have you as their Crimson Double.",
    "80FF54F3": "Enjoying the Crimson Days, Guardian?",
    "80FF54F4": "Come to spread some Dawning cheer? How thoughtful. That's why you're my favorite Guardian.",
    "80FF54F5": "Dawning, for me, is a time of family, warm drinks, and overindulgence on peppermints and chocolate coins.",
    "80FF54F6": "Marc and I always outdo one another with gifts during the Dawning. This year is season tickets to the Peregrine Opera House. I'm hoping for a wheel of fu'an cheese.",
    "80FF54F7": "Cayde may be gone, but he will not be forgotten. Just ask anyone on the Farm.",
    "80FF54F8": "I can't walk around the Farm without hearing Cayde's name. He is beloved.",
    "80FF54F9": "Sounds like the Reef is in dissaray. I do hope you're doing your best to calm it down.",
    "80FF54FA": "I can't say whether avenging Cayde was the right thing to do. I pray I never find myself in a similar situation.",
    "80FF54FB": "I heard about the trouble on the Reef. I'll stick to my troubles down here, thank you.",
    "80FF54FC": "After what happened on the Reef, I'd hope a smart person would think twice before crossing you.",
    "80FF54FD": "Stories about the Dreaming City have made their way to the Farm. Is it as beautiful as it sounds?",
    "80FF54FE": "Do whatever you need to do to keep the trouble in the Dreaming City at bay. We don't need any of that here, thank you.",
    "80FF54FF": "I hope the Awoken are treating you well. They are not known for their hospitality.",
    "80BD12C8": "Come now, show yourself. That's all I need.",
    "80BD12CA": "I see you, little bug.",
    "80BD12CC": "Put your head in my sights and we can both take a break.",
    "80BD12CE": "Ah, there you are.",
    "80BD12D0": "On your way, little bug. Nothing to see up here.",
    "80BD12D2": "Come on, old man. You stood upon the Wall for years. You can last as long as she needs.",
    "80BD12D4": "Suraya, your frequent check-ins break my concentration. Let an old man snipe in peace, will you?",
    "80BD12D6": "My dear Marc, I am toasty warm, I assure you. Though, uh, you might send me more tea.",
    "80BD12D8": "Well, now. Where are you going?",
    "80BD12DA": "There they go again. Dance, my Guardian friend.",
    "80BD12DC": "Four arms, and still I'm a better shot than you.",
    "80BD12DE": "Hot cocoa. Homemade Fu'an cheese. Baked clams. Oh! I miss you, Marc Ahem.",
    "80FF5500": "The Farm. My home away from home. I truly have come to adore it. ",
    "80FF5501": "There's something tragically beautiful about living in view of the Shard of the Traveler. Everyone at the Farm feels it.",
    "80FF5502": "I quite love getting together with friends and kicking the old ball around the Farm. The smell of the early morning dew as you run across the field.",
    "80FF5503": "It might take a bit of convincing to get Marc to spend some time at the Farm. He's a city dweller at heart. ",
    "80FF5504": "I've found a keen little nook near the top of the barn where I enjoy watching the sunset over the Shard. It's relaxing.",
    "80BD12E0": "Eyes open.",
    "80BD12E2": "Here we are.",
    "80BD12E4": "You can hear that, too?",
    "80BD12E6": "Let's bring them home, you and I, huh?",
    "80BD12E8": "Ready if you are.",
    "80BD12EA": "Did you wish to discuss something?",
    "80BD12EC": "Happy to help with something, if you need it. There's no one else out here.",
    "80BD12EE": "What's the word?",
    "80BD12F0": "Be careful out there.",
    "80BD12F2": "Looking for something?",
    "80BD12F4": "What can I do for you?",
    "80BD12F6": "Come now, speak your mind. ",
    "80BD12F8": "The Dead Zone. Ahh. Fitting name.",
    "80BD12FA": "Someday I shall look back on this and laugh. Well, Marc will laugh.",
    "80BD12FC": "One shot. One shot for every friend we've lost. ",
    "80BD12FE": "Look at this place. Dreadful. I should write a book about it. ",
    "80BD1300": "What do the Fallen hope to find out here? Nowhere is safe for them now.",
    "80BD1302": "The intel seems accurate. No House banners. No Devils, no Wolves. They've thrown it all away. ",
    "80BF4B34": "Let me know what you think!",
    "80BF4B36": "I've checked it myself. Should suffice.",
    "80BF4B38": "Kick them in the teeth! If you would.",
    "80BF4B40": "I hope you get something just a little bit grand.",
    "80BF4B42": "And this, I believe, is for you.",
    "80BF4B44": "I do hope it goes with your wardrobe?",
    "80BF4B49": "The techs at the Farm guarantee its quality.",
    "80BF4C36": "With my hearty thanks, Guardian.",
    "80BF4C6F": "Ahh, cheers.",
    "80BF4C72": "Thanks for this!",
    "80BF4C74": "We'll find a use, don't worry.",
    "80BF4C76": "Ahh! Appreciate it.",
    "80BF4C78": "Hmm. Well done. ",
    "80BF4C7A": "Good, good! ",
    "80BF4C7C": "I'm grateful, Guardian.",
    "80BF4C7E": "We'll make good use of this.",
    "80BF4C80": "Many thanks.",
    "80BF4C82": "A good choice.",
    "80BF4C84": "I hope it serves you well.",
    "80BF4C86": "Do be careful with that.",
    "80BF4C88": "Hmm. I hope it is helpful.",
    "80BF4C8A": "Use it carefully.",
    "80BF4C8C": "May it keep you safe.",
    "80BF4C8E": "Do not regret this. You've made a good choice.",
    "80BF4C9D": "Treat it well, Guardian.",
    "80BF4C9F": "Now we see how it does in the field.",
    "80BF4CA1": "Yes, I think that's a good one.",
    "80BF4CA3": "Oh, look at that. Good kit is hard to come by.",
    "80BF4CA5": "Don’t forget the upkeep. They always forget the upkeep.",
    "80BF4CA7": "Not many like that outside the City, now.",
    "80BF4CA9": "You have an eye for quality.",
    "80BF4CAB": "Use it well, my friend. Make them pay.",
    "80BF4CAD": "Goodbye, Guardian.",
    "80BF4CAF": "Mind your rockets now, Guardian.",
    "80BF4CB1": "Good luck.",
    "80BF4CB3": "Stay low, and move quietly.",
    "80BF4CB5": "Aim well, my friend.",
    "80BF4CCE": "See you soon.",
    "80BF4D0D": "That Glimmer has our names all over it!",
    "80BF4D0F": "Ooh, that's a pret-ty pile of Glimmer. Hold 'em off while I transmat this.",
    "80BF4D11": "Hey Devrim! Glimmer incoming!",
    "80BF4D13": "Another impeccable smash and grab. Well done!",
    "80BF4D15": "One giant heap of Glimmer incoming! ",
    "80BF4D17": "My word. You'll have to keep some for yourself, you know.",
    "80BF4D19": "Clearly you're someone worth knowing, and I flatter myself that I might be the same to you. Stop by.",
    "80BF4D1B": "We drove them off! As usual.",
    "80BF4D1D": "Any interference to their Glimmer mining operations is most welcome.",
    "80BF4D1F": "Ha, there they go. We kept them busy!",
    "80BF4D21": "I doubt they got much Glimmer, thanks to you.",
    "80BF4D23": "Devrim, we took out their Drill! They're on the run!",
    "80BF4D25": "As effective as ever, I see. Good work!",
    "80BF4D27": "There goes the drill! Ha!",
    "80BF4D29": "A tricky business, mining Glimmer without a drill! Good work.",
    "80BF4D2B": "Do they still think they can outrun us?",
    "80BF4D2D": "They're heading to another site!",
    "80BF4D2F": "There they go again!",
    "80BF4D31": "We'll teach them not to dig around here!",
    "80BF4D33": "I have full confidence in you.",
    "80BF4D35": "A Glimmer mining crew!",
    "80BF4D37": "Shut them down!",
    "80BF4D39": "Oops. They got the Glimmer.",
    "80BF4D87": "And YOU got their equipment. Excellent work, again.",
    "80BF4D89": "They got the Glimmer. But I'd like to see them dig up more without equipment!",
    "80BF4D8B": "They'd break their claws and swear, I don't doubt. Well done!",
    "80BF4D8D": "I'm reading a skiff with Glimmer mining equipment aboard, Guardian. Interested?",
    "80BF4D8F": "Looks like the Fallen are bringing in a Glimmer Drill. Keep a sharp lookout.",
    "80BF4D9F": "There goes the ship. Chin up, you'll get another shot.",
    "80BF4EB7": "I didn't hear from you, but I did see that skiff go by. That's all right. We'll get them next time!",
    "80BF4EC7": "One Taken champion chased away!",
    "80BF4EC9": "He'll be feeling that tomorrow. Superlative, Guardian. You never disappoint.",
    "80BF4ECF": "Whatever it was, we drove it back to—where do Taken go?",
    "80BF4ED7": "Far away from here, I hope. Well done indeed.",
    "80BF4EE9": "Aw, they got away!",
    "80BF4EEB": "Never fear, there's plenty more where that came from.",
    "80BF4EED": "Energy readings are stable now. Resume duties. I'll keep an eye on this area.",
    "80BF4EEF": "That's another win against the Taken!",
    "80BF4EF1": "A top-notch operation, as I've learned to expect from you.",
    "80BF4EF3": "Ha! Devrim, we beat them!",
    "80BF4EF5": "Of course you did. Never had any doubts.",
    "80BF4EF7": "I'm impressed by you, stranger. Drop by for tea sometime and say hello.",
    "80BF4EF9": "Yes! Another Taken champion down!",
    "80BF4F07": "Down and dusted indeed. And here I thought you were done surprising me.",
    "80BF4F09": "(noise of relief) Okay, Devrim! We killed the big Taken guy!",
    "80BF4F29": "Won't be your last, I wager. Savor this victory. I know I will.",
    "80BF4F2B": "Picking up some aberrations in reality. We both know what that means.",
    "80BF4F2D": "Any Guardians nearby? Local energy fields are spiking like mad!",
    "80BF4F2F": "Here come the Taken again!",
    "80BF4F31": "At this point, I could set my watch by them.",
    "80BF4F33": "Taken!",
    "80BF4F35": "Filthy creatures. Push them back!",
    "80BF4F37": "Get ready! The Blight's opening!",
    "80BF4F39": "Whatever made that Blight is coming through!",
    "80BF4F3B": "The Taken are leaving! But I was having fun!",
    "80BF4F3D": "Good riddance, for now.",
    "80BF4F3F": "They're running away!",
    "80BF4F41": "And my instruments have stopped making such a racket. Thanks to you, I presume.",
    "80BF4F46": "We've got to get that shield down! Look around for something we can use!",
    "80BF4F4A": "Unless we disable that shield, we're sitting ducks out here!",
    "80BF4F4C": "That shield is making me mad! We've got to get rid of it!",
    "80BF4F4E": "Where is an overcharged solar cell when you need one?",
    "80BF4F50": "The tech behind that shield is too durable. We have to find another way to destroy it!",
    "80BF4F52": "We did it! And we didn't blow up.",
    "80BF4F54": "Yeah, not blowing up is as good as you can hope for sometimes.",
    "80BF4F7A": "Way to reach for the stars.",
    "80BF4F7E": "Sounded like a nice dunk!",
    "80BF4F80": "'Dunk'?",
    "80BF4F82": "Yeah, that's what we Guardians call it when we jam a radioactive fuel cell into an exhaust vent. You wouldn't understand.",
    "80BF4F84": "Nice work! That should take care of the barrier!",
    "80BF4F86": "Well, THIS looks familiar.",
    "80BF4F88": "Yeah, funny story about the Oh-roh? Oh-roh Oh-roh-bahn uh",
    "80BF4F9A": "Cabal and their weird ship names. Think it was the 'Orobas Vectura.'",
    "80BF4F9C": "Yeah, that one. Zahn moved in after you put Thumos out to pasture. He's in there somewhere.",
    "80BF51A5": "The ship is still here!",
    "80BF51A8": "Zahn moved in after you put Thumos down. Surprised he hasn't painted the place chartreuse to match his armor.",
    "80BF51AA": "I'm sorry, painted it what now?",
    "80BF51AE": "Ah nothing.",
    "80BF51B0": "One less tank to worry about. But we need to get up that elevator!",
    "80BF51B2": "Now that we've dealt with the tank problem, we can focus on lowering that elevator. Look for control panels!",
    "80BF51B4": "Got it!",
    "80BF51B6": "The elevator?",
    "80BF51B8": "No, the tank. NOW comes the elevator.",
    "80BF51BA": "Hey, Cayde. Ten glimmer says there's a tank on that elevator.",
    "80BF51BC": "Please don't encourage him.",
    "80BF51BE": "[Whispers] You're on.",
    "80BF51C0": "We're inside the ship again. But Zahn can't be far now.",
    "80BF51C2": "Could be some really weird defenses in there. Not just flame turrets—I'm talking REALLY weird.",
    "80BF51C4": "Don't mess with them. They need to stay focused.",
    "80BF51C6": "Back into the ship we go. We're coming for you, Zahn.",
    "80BF51C8": "He's got a lot to answer for. Be thorough.",
    "80BF51CB": "Another tank. There was another tank on the elevator.",
    "80BF51CD": "Oh, come on! ANOTHER one?",
    "80BF51CF": "Hawthorne, you're not going to believe this.",
    "80BF51D1": "Wait wait, wait! Let me guess—giant flame turret.",
    "80BF51D3": "No. But thanks for that image.",
    "80BF51D5": "That tank's between us and Bracus Zahn.",
    "80BF51D7": "I think you should blow up the tank.",
    "80BF51D9": "He's a master tactician.",
    "80BF51DB": "Almost back to the surface.",
    "80BF5211": "Watch for air support. This guy's too smart to not have a backup plan.",
    "80BF5213": "Eh, backup plans are overrated.",
    "80BF5215": "Here we go!",
    "80BF5233": "Now we've got you, Zahn! In a place you know way better than us.",
    "80BF5235": "But that won't stop us. Let's get him!",
    "80BF523F": "We're here. End of the line for you, Zahn!",
    "80BF5245": "Watch your six. And your twelve. You know what—just—just be careful.",
    "80BF5247": "This is it. We've got him cornered in an airfield. OK",
    "80BF5249": "There he is! Bracus Zahn is here!",
    "80BF524B": "Try to grab his flame turret blueprints after he's dead.",
    "80BF524D": "We found Zahn!",
    "80BF524F": "Don't let him escape.",
    "80BF5251": "Zahn is here!",
    "80BF5253": "And the flame turrets? Is he using the flame turrets?",
    "80BF5255": "YES.",
    "80BF5257": "Uh turns out Zahn's network is different from the Red Legion's.",
    "80BF5259": "Good different or bad different?",
    "80BF525B": "Did I just see a FLARE shoot into the sky?",
    "80BF525D": "Look, let's not get into what might have shot into the sky and which enemy just summoned a bunch of reinforcements.",
    "80BF525F": "He sounds like you.",
    "80BF5261": "Aww, thank you!",
    "80BF5263": "Did you shoot up a flare? I thought we weren't allowed to have flares anymore after I... had nothing to do with why we're not allowed to have flares.",
    "80BF5265": "It wasn't us! They must have detected me in their network.",
    "80BF5267": "Then I'd get ready for reinforcements. A lot of reinforcements.",
    "80BF5269": "Door's unlocked. But I couldn't get through without tripping their master alarm.",
    "80BF526B": "Not a trade I would have made, but you're the one on the ground.",
    "80BF526D": "Come on, how bad could one little alarm be?",
    "80BF526F": "Very bad.",
    "80BF5271": "We're through. And I made things more exciting.",
    "80BF5273": "Don't sound so down, little guy. Fireteams are built for excitement!",
    "80BF5275": "I think they were waiting for us this time.",
    "80BF5277": "Sometimes the best way to spring a trap is to spring the trap.",
    "80BF5279": "Alternatively, don't be there when it springs.",
    "80BF527B": "We'll have to try that next time!",
    "80BF527D": "That tank just exposed a solar fuel cell!",
    "80BF527F": "Wait a minute—there's a high concentration of solar energy over there!",
    "80BF5281": "Thanks for moving that tank out of the way. Head for that solar fuel cell!",
    "80BF5283": "Scanners show reinforcements coming.",
    "80BF5285": "That last harvester exposed an active fuel cell. Maybe we can use it!",
    "80BF5287": "Attaboy.",
    "80BF5289": "That last tank didn't finish refueling before it got airlifted out.",
    "80BF528B": "Amanda told me Cabal fuel makes a pretty good accelerant.",
    "80BD15A3": "Time for me to step out. Cayde, I leave it to you.",
    "80BD15A4": "OK, fireteam: there's a lot to cover as your official operative in the strike against Bracus Zahn, so we'd better get started. Item the first:",
    "80BD15A5": "Strike's been started for a while.",
    "80BD15A6": "...Huh.",
    "80BD15A7": "Into the action right away. I'm not surprised. Cayde, you're up.",
    "80BD15A8": "Whoa, wait wait wait, I'm not ready! I had a whole thing for this Zahn guy—I had charts and pictures—you know what, the one time I get it all—geez, forget it. You know what, just forget it.",
    "80BD15A9": "Usually for an operation like this, Zavala provides logistical support. But it sounds like it's just us this time around.",
    "80BD15AA": "Hawthorne, where'd you put my datapad? It had the notes about that thing I'm in charge of.",
    "80BD15AB": "You mean the Bracus Zahn strike that's already running? Off to a great start, Mr. Vanguard.",
    "80BD15AC": "Bracus Zahn's days of supplying weapons to the Red Legion will soon be over. Fireteam, I'm leaving Operation Forge in the hands of Suraya Hawthorne.",
    "80BD15AD": "Also, Cayde will be there Good luck.",
    "80BD15AE": "Fireteam: an urgent matter requires my attention. Hawthorne has volunteered to handle your strike on this end.",
    "80BD15AF": "Wait, are they going after the weapons guy? You said I could do that one!",
    "80BD15B0": "I lied. Good luck, fireteam.",
    "80BD15B1": "Your target is Bracus Zahn. Weapons dealer to the Red Legion—can I help you, Cayde?",
    "80BD15B2": "Ikora said she needed you. Don't worry, I got this one!",
    "80BD15B3": "I'll keep an eye on him. No problem.",
    "80BD15B4": "Be brave, fireteam.",
    "80BF5333": "That was not the right algorithm. It's OK! It's OK.",
    "80BF5335": "Maybe not. Got a lot of Fallen chatter on intercept.",
    "80BF5337": "Ah, we've been handling Fallen since your uncle Devrim was in diapers. No problem!",
    "80BF5339": "Says the guy who got stuck in an interdimensional leg snare.",
    "80BF533B": "No more enemies in here. There are plenty outside, though. Get me to a console, and we'll get out there.",
    "80BF533D": "All the paths to the rest of the base are shut tight. But get me to a console, and I'll take care of that.",
    "80BF533F": "We need to get further into the base. If I can access their network...",
    "80BF5341": "What are those Cabal doing out there? We need to get past this security door.",
    "80BD15CE": "The Fallen in the base is a new wrinkle. Make sure you account for that, Cayde. Zavala out.",
    "80BD15CF": "Fallen must want whatever weapons this Bracus Zahn has been cooking up.",
    "80BD15D0": "Can you blame them? I heard there were turrets that shoot FIRE.",
    "80BD15D1": "Uh really?",
    "80BF5347": "There's an exhaust vent nearby, but I don't know how long you want to hang onto that thing!",
    "80BF53AB": "OK, I didn't mean for you to pick it up! But we'll work with this.",
    "80BF53AF": "Is this what 'be brave' means for you Guardians? Didn't know it was a prayer.",
    "80BF53B1": "A true Guardian grabs the danger and walks around with it.",
    "80BF53B3": "What's that hissing noise?",
    "80BF53B5": "That's me! I must have Oh, wait a minute. Nope, not me.",
    "80BF53B7": "It's us! He's carrying the fuel cell!",
    "80BF53B9": "Nice!",
    "80BF53BB": "Great! Grab it, and uh, what's the plan, here?",
    "80BF53BD": "Plan, schman. Take the radioactive thing, put in explode-y place. There! There's your plan.",
    "80BF53BF": "I've heard worse.",
    "80BF53C1": "I can't believe it. You were right. He grabbed it.",
    "80BF53C3": "It's what I would have done.",
    "80BF53C5": "It's not what ANYONE should have done!",
    "80BF53C7": "Why would you pick it up?!",
    "80BF53C9": "So he can find where it'll do the most damage. Smart.",
    "80BF53CB": "Is it?!",
    "80BF53CD": "Still haven't been able to track down Zahn. Cabal usually LIKE to be found.",
    "80BF53CF": "This guy's no ordinary space rhino. His weapons ain't half bad, either.",
    "80BF53D1": "Those weapons have snuffed out too many good people.",
    "80BF53D3": "Oh, don't get me wrong. He'll still deserve whatever this fireteam gives him. They always do.",
    "80BF53D5": "Zahn's lieutenants aren't messing around. Think we've seen the last of them?",
    "80BF53D7": "He's bound to have more. Insecure men tend to surround themselves with others like them.",
    "80BF53D9": "Cayde? Anything to add?",
    "80BF53DB": "Nope, she's totally right. Which is why I work alone.",
    "80BF53DD": "A tank—for us? Hawthorne, you shouldn't have!",
    "80BF53DF": "Amanda would want me to remind you to call it the Drake.",
    "80BF53E1": "I think you should call it 'payback.'",
    "80BF53E3": "Tank! Tank! One of ours, I mean!",
    "80BF5462": "Amanda Holliday was able to scrounge one up. Try to keep it in one piece.",
    "80BF54D1": "Now we're talking. Let's get in that tank and bust them up!",
    "80BF54D3": "Why does everyone get a tank but me?!",
    "80BF5533": "Whew! Glad someone else grabbed that fuel cell. Let's help them out!",
    "80BF553B": "That solar cell might be the only way to get the barrier down. Good thinking!",
    "80BF553F": "OK, they grabbed it. Better them than us. Time to clear a path!",
    "80BF5541": "Got him!",
    "80BF5543": "Without Zahn, the Red Legion will be back to throwing rocks before too long. Great work.",
    "80BF5545": "You ever been hit with a rock? Don't joke about that. [To himself] Ah, I miss Eris.",
    "80BF5547": "We did it! Zahn won't be making any more scary new weapons for the Red Legion.",
    "80BF5549": "Oh, they will have to use regular old weapons.",
    "80BF554B": "Those we can handle. Nice job.",
    "80BF554D": "Target eliminated.",
    "80BF5550": "Great work, fireteam.",
    "80BF5554": "OK, you all are getting way too formal. Where's the energy? Let's hear some chatter out there! Huh?",
    "80BF5556": "The job's done, Cayde. You can handle the chatter for a while.",
    "80BF5558": "Don't mind if I do.",
    "80BF555A": "Take that, Zahn! Yeah!",
    "80BF555C": "Sounds like I returned at just the right time. Excellent work, fireteam.",
    "80BF555E": "Thanks, boss! It was by the book, the whole way.",
    "80BF5560": "Does this say 'flame turret'?",
    "80BF5562": "Don't forget about the signal flares.",
    "80BF5564": "[Sighs]",
    "80BF5566": "I liked this place better when there wasn't a Cabal TANK in it.",
    "80BF5568": "Why would they put a tank inside a ship?",
    "80BF556A": "Cause Zahn's running scared. Don't let up, fireteam.",
    "80BF556C": "No sign of Zahn. But that elevator's the only way forward. Forward and up.",
    "80BF556E": "The Cabal made an elevator that goes forward? Man, they ARE inefficient.",
    "80BF5570": "Remember that elevator? Looks like we have to bring it down again.",
    "80BF5654": "That sounds easy.",
    "80BF5656": "There's a tank here.",
    "80BF5659": "OK, well, there are many levels of easy.",
    "80BF565B": "Well, it wouldn't be a Red Legion base without another indoor tank.",
    "80BF565D": "There he is! Now we've got him.",
    "80BF5704": "Good.",
    "80BF5706": "And his turrets.",
    "80BF5708": "Not so good.",
    "80BF570A": "And a ketch full of Fallen. No problem!",
    "80BD1A4B": "(sigh) A great example of how the Legion works. Their technology is as brutal as they are. Conquer, control, and then pave it over.",
    "80BD1A4F": "Hmm, interesting. Some of the trace signatures here match readings from the Psions. Maybe these supplies originated on the Psion homeworld.",
    "80BD1A51": "Ugh, look at this. Why would you make machinery so ugly? Technology doesn't have to be like this, you know. Just look at me!",
    "80FF5505": "This component was shipped here from the Dantalion Exodus. Remember? That big Cabal ship that crashed into the Dreadnaught. I guess we found out where its distress signal went.",
    "80BD1A55": "The power in even this tiny piece  it's amazing. And to think it's been out here this whole time. Just waiting.",
    "80BD1A57": "I can see some of the data going through this thing. The Red Legion at the base are talking to soldiers on Mars, Venus, Nessus  they're everywhere.",
    "80BD1A59": "A prototype, or the runt of the litter? Or are the Archon Priests trying out new shell designs ",
    "80FF5507": "This base is typical Cabal: trying to do everything all at once, and doing none of it well. Ikora said once that 'when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.' I guess the Cabal prefer to bury the nail under a mountain of hammers.",
    "80BD1A5D": "Why would you store refueling information in a remote access point all the way up here? I swear, I will never understand Cabal architecture.",
    "80FF5509": "I think it's a modification for an air filtration system, which is a modification on top of this generator. But the Cabal don't breathe our atmosphere, so... why did they build it in the first place?",
    "80BD1A61": "Fallen comms, still trying to reach their brothers and sisters. Some of these headers are still marked with House sigils. House of Devils, House of Wolves ... ",
    "80BD1A63": "Looks like an improvised explosive device set up by the Fallen. They hate the Cabal as much as we do. ",
    "80BD1A65": "Scanning  hmm. I'm picking up trace elements from a half dozen planets on this thing. The Cabal sure do get to travel, don't they?",
    "80BD1A67": "Supplies marked for the House of Judgement. ... I wonder what happened to Variks. You think the Reef survived the Red Legion?",
    "80BD1A69": "More abandoned supplies. Huh. The Fallen are harder to clear out than cockroaches!",
    "80BD1A6B": "I wonder if these supplies fell out of a Fallen skiff. Or a ketch. Fallen names are so ugly. Dreg. Wretch. There are other things besides short vowels and plosives, you know.",
    "80BD1A6D": "Another Fallen antenna, all the way out here. They're desperate to get everyone they can together. Interesting ...",
    "80BD1A6F": "Another Fallen antenna, all the way out here. They're desperate to get everyone they can together. Wonder if they tried to reach their old homeworld with this?",
    "80BD1A71": "I've never seen a Servitor this... tiny. I wonder if it was a prototype for old Sepiks? Like, Sepiks... Beta. Sepiks Inferior? Anyway ",
    "80BD1A73": "This is some kind of... prototype for a Servitor. Abandoned next to a rock. Promise me you won't let ME end up like this.",
    "80BD1A75": "The Fallen used to worship the Servitors like gods. I wonder what they think of their machines now that they're down and out in the EDZ?",
    "80BD1A77": "More Fallen transmission data. I'm  well this is weird. I'm seeing some file headers with Awoken symbology? What's that about?",
    "80BD1A79": "I used to think the Fallen worshiped machines, but this doesn't look very worshipful, does it? Maybe they've got bigger worries these days ",
    "80BD1A7B": "What was that giant Shank made up of Servitor parts called? S.A.B.E.R.-2, right? I wonder if you can make a giant Servitor from a bag of Shank parts.",
    "80BD1A7D": "Is that  a sack full of Shanks? What do you think they're going to do with all that tech? Can you make a big Shank from a bunch of little Shanks?",
    "80BD1A7F": "An arc spear. We thought the House Fallen were bad, but its hard to imagine a haughty House of Kings guy rushing at us with one of these.",
    "80BD1A81": "A depleted arc spear from one of those stabby guys. The Fallen have always had it bad, but they've really started to get desperate, huh?",
    "80BD1A83": "An empty Fallen cache, hmm. They must be bringing in supplies from all of their old hidey holes to be able to survive out here.",
    "80BD1A85": "Hmm. Fallen comms. They're using this as a kind of beacon. I guess not everybody in the old Houses got the memo.",
    "80BD1A87": "This antenna was used on the Fallen network less than a year ago. It relayed a signal out past Saturn. I wonder if they knew about Nessus before we did?",
    "80BD1A89": "This antenna was used on the Fallen network less than a year ago. It relayed a signal past the Reef, past the Dreadnaught. I wonder if they knew about Nessus before we did?",
    "80BD1A8B": "I think the Fallen must have taken this from the Farm. Everybody has it bad out in the EDZ.",
    "80BD1A8D": "The Fallen must have tucked it away in here and forgotten about it. I'm getting  ohh. These supplies were originally from the Tower. ",
    "80BD1A8F": "Who knows why these banners are placed anymore? The Fallen Houses held them together for a long time. Now it's just  cloth.",
    "80BD1A91": "The Fallen hid this one pretty well. I guess after we beat them up during the SIVA crisis, they'd want to give us as wide a berth as possible.",
    "80BD1A93": "A forgotten crate / Hidden away in shadow / Probably empty",
    "80BD1A95": "Some interesting data in these things  hmm. I think they came all the way from Venus with the old House of Winter. ",
    "FFFFFFFF": "This is the House of Judgement sigil. We used to work with a Fallen who flew this banner.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Curious. Well, the Fallen seem to have put this up as a bit of a threat. I imagine you'll find lots of objects like this out there with a bit of a story to them.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "This is a Fallen House sigil. I don't recognize it, though.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Nor I. The Fallen seem to have put it up as something of a threat. I imagine you'll find lots of objects like this out there with a bit of a story to them.",
    "80BD1A97": "I'm not detecting any Ether. The Servitors keep the Fallen going with that stuff. Bet they took it all before they moved on.",
    "80BD1A99": "They were using this terminal to control the elevator. No wonder it almost crushed us into Guardian and Ghost soup.",
    "80BD1A9B": "This terminal was first powered on in the Cosmodrome during the SIVA crisis. Maybe we shouldn't get too close.",
    "80BD1A9D": "All the controls are broken. Someone must have gotten mad that it wasn't working fast enough. Reminds me of Cayde.",
    "80BD1A9F": "These House banners are rare on the ground these days. Between the Guardians and the Cabal, they've buried a lot of the old grudges. All four hands on deck.",
    "80FF550B": "The emergency light is still working, but the rest of this tech fizzled out a long time ago. I wonder how many people escaped after the Collapse.",
    "80FF550D": "A power box for an underground security system. I guess it wasn't enough to protect against the Collapse. And the Fallen. And the Hive. And the Taken. And the Red Legion. But I bet it worked pretty well against bears.",
    "80FF550F": "There's still some kind of energy in this Shard, but... different from what we use. I still don't understand how the corruption AND the Traveler's power can coexist so strongly. But I guess there's a lot we don't understand.",
    "80BD1AA7": "The Cabal used to be those cranky jerks out on Mars. Now their warmachine is all over Earth. Someday we'll get them out of the system. Right? ",
    "80BD1AB4": "Area's clear. Let's get back to that stash, so I can send it over.",
    "80FF55FC": "Hey, transmat's coming through fine, but a little Spider just told me Shin Malphur's been spotted in the EDZ.",
    "80FF55FE": "Remember him? Famous renegade. Golden Gun. Mad-on for revenge.",
    "80FF5600": "He and I had an arrangement. The EDZ was NOT part of that arrangement.",
    "80FF5602": "Come on back to base. We gotta regroup.",
    "80FF5604": "You've cleaned them out. These components are critical to the Rig's structural integrity. And thanks to you, we've got the tools to put them back.",
    "80FF5606": "Whatever the Fallen steal, we steal back.",
    "80FF5608": "While I cannot condone theft, I do appreciate payback. Well done.",
    "80FF560A": "Patching you the XYZ to the pickup site now.",
    "80FF560C": "You're lookin' for a big pile of salvage. You'll know it when you see it.",
    "80FF560E": "My crews will be reinforcing this Rig again in no time.",
    "80FF5610": "Those Fallen you tracked? We've located the rest of their gang. They're consolidating stolen Golden Age tech in a nice big pile out in the open.",
    "80FF5612": "Give those thieves a taste of their own medicine.",
    "80FF5614": "Does that Fallen look like a transmat beacon thief to you? He looks like a transmat beacon thief to me.",
    "80FF5616": "You're close. It's just around the corner.",
    "80FF5618": "I think that's the stash. Let's clear the area for transmat.",
    "80FF561A": "Huh. Transmat's down. Maybe the beacon's busted?",
    "80FF561C": "Eh Tell you what. Fallen crews around here jack Vanguard gear all the time.",
    "80FF561E": "See if you can find a spare beacon. I, uh, got a call coming through that I gotta take.",
    "80FF5620": "That's it! I'll set up a transmat. Wait Wait a minute. Where's my beacon?",
    "80FF5622": "Did the Fallen steal your transmat beacon too?",
    "80FF5624": "Sloane has stepped aside for a moment. The things she's shouting would blister your ears. May I recommend finding that beacon?",
    "80FF5626": "That one. That one's gotta be a transmat beacon thief. He looks even thief-ier than the first one.",
    "80FF5628": "OK, brother, this'll be a cake walk. You're just pickin' up a stash.",
    "80FF562A": "Clear out the area. I got Vanguard snitches breathing down my neck.",
    "80FF562C": "We don't need anybody followin' you.",
    "80FF562E": "Guardian! Fallen thieves headed in your direction!",
    "80FF5630": "They hit us and ran. We lost tools, gear My crews can't work without that stuff.",
    "80BD1AD9": "If their spell is weak, we might be able to shatter it. And them. But this is a guess.",
    "80BD1ADB": "We took out the Knight. But I'm not sure it's dead. Some kind of magic allowed it to escape.",
    "80BD1ADD": "New hive spells. Just what we need. Get after it, you two.",
    "80BD1ADF": "What do we have to do to kill this thing?",
    "80BD1AE3": "You were right, Sloane. Apply enough firepower and apparently even Hive magic breaks.",
    "80BD1AE5": "Good work, both of you. Holliday and I were just talking about how different we are from the Hive.",
    "80BD1AE7": "Yeah, yeah. They worship death. We serve the Light. Good vs. evil, black hats and white hats ... really makes you think.",
    "80BD1AE9": "Thinking about switching sides, Amanda? ",
    "80BD1AEB": "Oh no. Amanda goes rogue and we'll have Thrall buzzing the control center inside of a week. Ahem. Let's get back to work?",
    "80BD1AED": "I've been fighting Hive for ... well. Longer than I want to admit. This is some kind of ritual.",
    "80BD1AEF": "They're losing on purpose? Like ... what? Throwing a hand of poker?",
    "80BD1AF1": "Maybe. What's their goal, though? Why let this thing die over and over again?",
    "80BD1AF3": "This is just irritating. Now I know how the Cabal feel about us.",
    "80BD1AF5": "I'm not in the mood for this. Keep after him. Their spell can't keep it safe forever.",
    "80BD1AF7": "Good, it's you. I'm getting reports from Holliday's crews about a Knight with a strange aura around it. It's playing merry hell with our schedule.",
    "80BD1AF9": "My crews know how to get er' done, Sloane. Regular maintenance is the difference between a Sparrow that races and a Sparrow that rusts.",
    "80BD1AFB": "... sure. But this rig isn't winning any races. That Knight is in my way. Take it out.",
    "80BD1AFD": "All right. That's three. Sloane, you want us to keep going?",
    "80BD1AFF": "If this is a ritual, then all of this is leading somewhere. I want the two of you there at the end, whatever that looks like.",
    "80BD1B01": "All right. One more time. ",
    "80FF5632": "Guardian, we're reading some odd fluctuations in our scans.",
    "80FF5636": "Gravity waves. Small for now, but amp 'em up, and they'll rip us apart.",
    "80FF5638": "I've got three locations where the waves are strongest. Sending you coordinates.",
    "80FF563A": "Hey, that thing looks tasty. Give it a little nibble for me, brother.",
    "80FF563C": "Or is it a crime to be hungry, too?",
    "80FF563E": "Sloane, there's a giant crystal in here. ...It's SINGING.",
    "80FF5640": "Neutralize it!",
    "80FF5642": "We tear this altar down, we stop that horrible noise.",
    "80FF5644": "The sooner the better. We're hearing that sound on all sensors now. Feeling it, too.",
    "80FF5646": "I don't see anything, Sloane. But I—did you hear that?",
    "80FF5648": "What are you picking up?",
    "80FF564A": "It's gone. Maybe I'm imagining things. We'll check your other coordinates.",
    "80FF564C": "Do it quick. I don't like what I'm seeing.",
    "80FF564E": "So, what'd you get out of all this, huh? A fistful of Hive frass and a whole lotta nothing.",
    "80FF5650": "But you're not stupid. Neither is your Praxic friend. So why'd you do it, kid?",
    "80FF5652": "We're stable again! Whatever you did, it worked. My ... stomach thanks you.",
    "80FF5654": "Got a wild idea. How 'bout you send me that rock for analysis? Whaddaya say?",
    "80FF5656": "One big glowy rock, coming right up.",
    "80FF5658": "Silence it, Guardian.",
    "80FF565A": "Heya, snitch. A little spider told me you're lookin' for dirt on me.",
    "80FF565C": "I didn't wanna believe it, but here you are, running around the Arcology.",
    "80FF565E": "What do you think you're gonna find? My master plan? A diary, maybe? [scoff]",
    "80FF5660": "Hey team? We've torn down the altars.",
    "80FF5662": "Then we got a problem. Those must have been transmitters, not the source. Ritual's still going. We're jittering up, down, and sideways over here.",
    "80FF5664": "I feel sick.",
    "80FF5666": "Keep it together, girl.",
    "80FF5668": "We did not expect your friend Aunor.",
    "80FF5669": "Her investigation is wise. A trial.",
    "80FF566A": "Together, you will render judgment.",
    "80FF566B": "We admire your defiance.",
    "80FF566C": "But this is bigger than the Dredgen.",
    "80FF566D": "Bigger than even you.",
    "80FF566E": "Visit us in due time.",
    "80FF566F": "We will help you find the truths you seek.",
    "80FF5670": "Sloane, you have to hear this.",
    "80FF5672": "Oh, I hear it. Amanda's grabbed your data and is mapping the source now.",
    "80FF5674": "Sources. Three of 'em. Go shut 'em down!",
    "80FF5676": "Here's my guess. You and your Warlock friend are fixing to break my deal with the Vanguard.",
    "80FF5678": "You sicced Shin on the EDZ. You sicced the Nine on me. I see you coming.",
    "80FF567A": "Word of advice. If you're planning to take a shot at me, you best not miss.",
    "80FF567C": "You're a beaut, aren't ya? Ohh, the tests I'm going to run on you. I wonder how many pistons you can power. Sparrow thrusters, obviously, but what about warp drives, or?",
    "80FF567E": "I'm sure I'm going to hear all about what Amanda will use that for. What were the Hive doing with it?",
    "80FF5680": "Not to rush ya, but these waves are growin' fast.",
    "80FF5682": "Get over there, and we should be able to track those gravity waves back to their source.",
    "80FF5684": "Sloane, it's a ritual, a big one. They really ARE going to shake this Arcology to pieces.",
    "80FF5686": "Then let's do the same to them.",
    "80FF5688": "That Knight, he's singing like the crystal. Are they... drawing power from each other?",
    "80BD1B4B": "We got 'em, Sloane.",
    "80BD1B4F": "How bad's the damage?",
    "80BD1B51": "Minimal. Nothing your crews can't fix in a day or two. Really, it looks as good as new. More importantly, the resonator's gone!",
    "80BD1B53": "(sigh) I'll take your word for it.",
    "80BD1B55": "Eliminate the Wizards, destroy their project, and stabilize this Rig.",
    "80BD1B57": "Which way, Sloane?",
    "80BD1B59": "Up. You're looking for the top of a tower, the central platform.",
    "80BD1B5B": "What was that? I could feel the shaking from here. I said stabilize, not sink! What did you do?",
    "80BD1B5D": "Tell you later.",
    "80BD1B5F": "We've got their fuel cells! They won't be blowing up anything today. Hmm, I see what they were doing. Volatile catenary, percussion cap...",
    "80BD1B61": "Good. Sending you coordinates to the Hive.",
    "80BD1B63": "Right, coordinates, Hive... If we tweak this... and rejigger that... that should work.",
    "80BD1B65": "What should work?",
    "80BD1B67": "We'll call it a Hive Disruptor. Let's go disrupt some Hive.",
    "80BD1B69": "My crew says we've got two problems. Wizards on a tower roof, doing who knows what, and the Fallen they've spooked.",
    "80BD1B6B": "So who do we fight?",
    "80BD1B6D": "Fallen first. They're using fuel cells to build an explosive countermeasure to the Hive. Sloppy stuff. It'll blow us all sky high.",
    "80BD1B6F": "Interesting. As far as I can tell, this functions as an interdimensional resonator for reality manipulations.",
    "80BD1B71": "Let's blow it up.",
    "80BD1B74": "Our enemies have been looting whatever they can get their hands on. I need you to recover what they've stolen.",
    "80BD1B78": "We're running low on mission-critical supplies. Can I count on you for a supply run?",
    "80BD1B7A": "Our priority right now is resources. Take as much as you can, wherever you can.",
    "80BD1B7C": "We need to build a strong base on this rig for forward operations. We can't do it without fresh supplies.",
    "80BD1B7E": "We've intercepted enemy transmissions. Sounds like they got their hands on something interesting. See what you can find.",
    "80BD1B80": "The greatest defense is a thorough knowledge of the enemy. I want intel on their loadout. Find out what they're carrying.",
    "80BD1B82": "We may be able to gain the edge here if we crack this Golden Age tech. Keep an eye out for anything that might help us understand it.",
    "80BD1B84": "We lost one of the crew in an ambush. She was carrying sensitive materials, and I need you to recover them.",
    "80BD1B86": "Our supply chain's been disrupted. We're going to have to gather what we can from the locals.",
    "80BD1B88": "We came to Titan in search of resources: fuel for our fleet, tech to defeat our enemies. Take a look around. See what you find.",
    "80BD1B8A": "If the control center is ever going to be fully operational, we need supplies. Sending you a manifest.",
    "80BD1B8C": "One of our scavenging crews was ambushed. Sending you a list of replacements. Good hunting, Guardian.",
    "80BD1B8E": "Supplies are running low. Putting in a request and annotating with a multi-point plan. Optional, of course.",
    "80BD1B90": "Research is the only way we'll stay ahead of the Hive. Samples are crucial to this effort, Guardian. You understand.",
    "80BD1B92": "Power and life support systems are on, but struggling. The attached manifest should help us out.",
    "80BD1B94": "If we're ever going to reach peak efficiency out here, we'll need every advantage. Supplies, supplies, supplies. You know how it goes.",
    "80BD1B96": "We had a crew convoy returning with some much-needed material. They hit us hard and fast. Offsetting our losses would go a long way to improving morale.",
    "80BD1B98": "Whether it's the Hive or the Fallen, we cannot seem to get a convoy back to Control today. We need supplies to keep running, and you're our best runner.",
    "80BD1B9A": "I don't really follow most of the jargon, but my crews assure me we need more samples. I try to keep my tech-heads happy.",
    "80BD1B9C": "Earlier today, I had to duck a conduit that practically dropped onto my head. Manifest attached, and my assurance these supplies will be appreciated.",
    "80BD1BB1": "Seems like I lose someone in every crew I send out. What do you say to a bit of counter-ops? Push 'em back.",
    "80BD1BB5": "If we're going to hold on to this rig, we need to send a message. I suggest something... aggressive.",
    "80BD1BB7": "We lost a shipment of supplies in a firefight this morning. We can't afford to lose another. Clear the way.",
    "80BD1BB9": "Every mission on Titan is a challenge. You're my solution. Details attached.",
    "80BD1BBB": "We may be far beyond Earth, but the City lives within us. Give our friends here a little taste of home.",
    "80BD1BBD": "If we're going to make it out here, we need to manage morale. I find that blasting aliens into oblivion does wonders to boost the spirits.",
    "80BD1BBF": "I've got reports of increased enemy activity in all sectors. Push 'em back.",
    "80BD1BC1": "Got a crew scheduled to make some repairs on the rig, but I can't deploy 'em 'til it's quiet. Clear us a path, and we'll do the rest.",
    "80BD1BC3": "Guardian, I got my crews competing to take down the enemy. Last crew knocked out a squad of 10 in five minutes. Can you do better?",
    "80BD1BC5": "We'll need a significant reduction in enemy forces if the next part of my plan is to succeed. Get shooting, Guardian.",
    "80BD1BC7": "Take the fight to the enemy. Remind them that we are here to stay.",
    "80BD1BC9": "The enemy has a plan of their own. What they don't realize is I'm three steps ahead. Details attached.",
    "80BD1BCB": "If we can't suppress the enemy here, there's no hope of winning our future battles. Push them back.",
    "80BD1BCD": "The enemy rallies while our defense weakens. Drive them back.",
    "80BD1BCF": "I'm fond of a certain Golden Age saying: 'The best offense is a strong defense.' Try it on for size.",
    "80BD1BD1": "Sloane's crews are pinned down across all active sectors. Too much enemy activity. Calling all active Guardians to clear the way.",
    "80BD1BD3": "Outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered—but not outplanned. Sabotage the enemy before they have a chance to strike.",
    "80BD1BD5": "Morale is dropping among Sloane's crew, Guardian. I need you to make a stand. Show them we can beat these monsters.",
    "80BD1BD7": "We just lost our southern line. I refuse to abandon any front. Take it back.",
    "80BD1BD9": "Enemy forces outnumber us by more than 30 to 1, and that's just on the surface. I trust you can help us even the odds.",
    "80BD1BDB": "Our enemies are like the rain: relentless, infuriating. We can't stop the rain, but we can stop them.",
    "80BD1BDD": "We've got intel that the enemy's preparing for an attack on Central Command. Scatter them before they can rally.",
    "80BD1BDF": "The enemy's rallying. They're everywhere—if I had numbers like they do, we could storm every planet in this system!",
    "80BD1BE1": "Remember, Guardian—humans colonized Titan. Our enemies have no place here. This moon is ours.",
    "80BD1C08": "Sensor data is hard to come by out here, Guardian. Requesting a direct scan to offset our packet loss.",
    "80BD1C0A": "Please proceed to the following coordinates. On-site scanning is the only way we'll know a lightning strike from a summoning spell.",
    "80BD1C0C": "These storms make it almost impossible to capture data from the Control center. That means taking readings the old-fashioned way, up close and personal.",
    "80BD1C0E": "Requesting a scan. We've been struggling to pinpoint what's out there and, between you and me? No intel gives me the spooks.",
    "80BD1C10": "If we're going to stay here, we need to keep the plan moving ahead. A manual scan at these coordinates could be the next step.",
    "80BD1C12": "We need more data from the field. I've got a hunch, and I need to know if I'm right. Details attached.",
    "80BD1C14": "I'm requesting a scan at the following coordinates. Expect enemy resistance heh, as if I need to remind *you.*",
    "80BD1C16": "We could have an opportunity to subvert enemy communications. We'll need an on-site scan to be sure.",
    "80BD1C18": "I need a manual scan, stat. Looking to confirm data sent out by one of my crews. They're counting on you, Guardian.",
    "80BD1C1A": "One of my crews just returned with an incomplete scan. Go show them how it's done.",
    "80BD1C1C": "Without Ikora's Hidden, our intel on enemy communications is poor, at best. Can I ask you for a scan?",
    "80BD1C1E": "Lightning just took out the remote scanning array at the Control Center. Requesting a field scan from any active Guardian.",
    "80BD1C20": "Sloane just intercepted a priority broadcast, but the enemy keeps changing the frequencies. See if you have more luck than us.",
    "80BD1C22": "Sloane's crew needs to know the resonant frequency of some... thing. I'll send you a manifest. See if you can put eyes on one.",
    "80BD1C24": "We came here to understand and reclaim Golden Age technology. Let's work on understanding it first.",
    "80BD1C26": "The enemy is cloaking their comms channel. Get close. Intercept a transmission. I want to know what they're planning.",
    "80BD1C28": "The Last City fell because we lacked an understanding of our enemy. We will not make the same mistake here.",
    "80BD1C2A": "Intel says you're not far from technology that may be pertinent to our mission. Sensor data would clarify things.",
    "80BD1C2C": "I'm authorizing manual scans on anything that seems like it may be valuable to the resistance. Call it the 'grab bag' protocol.",
    "80BD1C2E": "Guardian, we're picking up on strange radiation from an object near your current sector. Can you put eyes on it? Might be nothing.",
    "80BD1C31": "Long-range scanners are almost useless out here. No substitute for eyes on the ground. Good luck.",
    "80BD1C35": "I keep joking with the techs. This place is Golden Age all the way down, but we have to do things the old fashioned way. Details for a survey inbound.",
    "80BD1C37": "I'm looking to build a comprehensive report behind enemy lines. Get to this patch, and we'll have another piece of the puzzle.",
    "80BD1C39": "Sending you some coordinates, Guardian. We need eyes on this location, and we need them now.",
    "80BD1C3B": "We're starved for intel out here. Passing you coordinates and wishing you good luck, Guardian.",
    "80BD1C3D": "We might have an opportunity near these coordinates. At your own pace, Guardian.",
    "80BD1C3F": "Actionable intel is in short supply out here. Submitting a request, alongside my thanks.",
    "80BD1C41": "Have a survey operation here with your name on it, Guardian. ",
    "80BD1C43": "Sloane doesn't have enough spare crew for good recon. Not her fault; it's mine. Can I ask you to run a quick survey op?",
    "80BD1C45": "We believe this location may be a forward staging area for enemy strikes. Requesting on-site confirmation.",
    "80BD1C47": "I can't protect this moon if I don't understand our fronts. I need your eyes in the field.",
    "80BD1C49": "Sloane and I are planning to deploy a crew near your current location. Survey the terrain. Report back on the conditions.",
    "80BD1C4B": "Enemy broadcasts are talking about some flood near your current location. I'll believe it when you see it.",
    "80BD1C4D": "We know almost nothing of the enemy's true intentions here. Take a look around. If we have to get this intel the old-fashioned way, so be it.",
    "80BD1C4F": "Things are quiet enough that I feel comfortable deploying you on a survey, Guardian.",
    "80BD1C51": "We need eyes in the field, stat. Sending coordinates now. ",
    "80BD1C76": "I'm tracking a high-value target, Guardian.We may only have a short window to take it down.",
    "80BD1C78": "Looks like the enemy's getting sloppy. One of their major players is out in the open with minimal backup. You know what to do.",
    "80BD1C7A": "Got a priority target for you, Guardian. Hunt it down.",
    "80BD1C7C": "We have a chance to swing the tide in this theatre, Guardian. Coordinates identified for a priority target. Good hunting.",
    "80BD1C7E": "One of my crews just sent word, we've got a high value target in play. This is too good a chance to pass up. Details attached.",
    "80BD1C80": "We have visual confirmation on a high priority hostile. Don't let the old man down, Guardian.",
    "80BD1C82": "We're tracking a high value target, and you're the first Guardian I thought of. Sweep and clear.",
    "80BD1C84": "You're like me, Guardian. You like the tough assignments. That's why I'm sending this one to you. Get it done.",
    "80BD1C86": "A priority target just entered your sector. Sending coordinates for field tracking.",
    "80BD1C88": "We have an opportunity to take out an enemy commander. They're growing careless.",
    "80BD1C8A": "There's an enemy commander near your active coordinates. Strike fast and strike hard.",
    "80BD1C8C": "Sending you intel on a high-value target. I'd trust no one else with this detail. Good luck.",
    "80BD1C8E": "The enemy is growing careless. One of their mid-level bosses is traveling without an escort. Hunt her down.",
    "80BD1C90": "I've got word of a VIP target near your location. It would be huge if we could take this guy out.",
    "80BD1C92": "Guardian. An enemy leader is mobilizing troops near your coordinates. Find him. Cut him down. Teach them the danger of gathering together.",
    "80BD1C94": "A raiding party took out one of Sloane's crews. They had a leader. Cut him down.",
    "80BD1C97": "I, uh... didn't mean to free the Captain.",
    "80BD1C9B": "Huh. Golden Age safety checkpoints. Still operational, too.",
    "80BD1C9D": "Cycling power. Let's find the other one.",
    "80BD1C9F": "We're free, let's get out of here.",
    "80BD1CA1": "[In another language, 'Reactor initializing. Returning recognized life forms to safety zones.']",
    "80BD1CA3": "I can see the reactor on heat scans, bright and clear. Well done, Guardian.",
    "80BD1CA5": "Now all we have to do is get to it before the Fallen do. Should be easy. Right?",
    "80BD1CA7": "Hey, look who it is! The Captain. And it looks like he's stuck. Too bad.",
    "80BD1CA9": "Don't let him distract you. Wake up that reactor!",
    "80BD1CAB": "That's two.... Wait.",
    "80BD1CAD": "Devices that require multiple, separate activations? Aren't those, you know, really dangerous?",
    "80BD1CAF": "Did I say the reactor was safe?",
    "80BD1CB1": "Here I was thinking you liked us.",
    "80BD1CB3": "The people Sloane likes tend to wind up in crossfire in indefensible positions. Ask me how I know.",
    "80BD1CB5": "It's because I trust you to survive, Commander.",
    "80BD1CB7": "All right. With those terminals refreshed, we've pinpointed the reactor's bootup console. Light 'em up.",
    "80BD1CB9": "With your data, Holliday's been able to dig out the locations of two terminals in the reactor's auxiliary system. They appear to be on the fritz.",
    "80BD1CBB": "We need you to get in there and cycle the power. That should clear up the noise and restore the core systems as well.",
    "80BD1CBE": "Not a coincidence, looks like they're using Servitors to wall us in.",
    "80BD1CC2": "I can get this open! Just hold them off!",
    "80BD1CC4": "That barrier's energy spectrum matches this Servitor's. It could be a coincidence.",
    "80BD1CC6": "Ah, good. You're here. I presume Sloane's briefed you?",
    "80BD1CC8": "We go in. We scare the Fallen out of the control center. We get out.",
    "80BD1CCA": "Affirmative. Reports say we're dealing with one Captain and his crew. This should be routine, for someone like you.",
    "80BD1CCC": "Everything the Fallen got, we've got. Let's move.",
    "80BD1CCE": "That's it! Let's go!",
    "80FF55F7": "[Fallen speech]",
    "80BD1CD4": "Whew. We're through. I hope this data is worth it.",
    "80BD1CD6": "Indeed. In the meantime, you've ensured the Rig will stand for at least one more day.",
    "80BD1CD8": "Well said, sir. Come on by when you can, Guardian. We'll a look at what you got.",
    "80BD1CDA": "Looks like they wanted data, not systems control. Linking up with their taps.",
    "80BF5C7D": "Hey, Sloane! Guess what we've got?",
    "80BF5C9A": "Is it a methane reactor?",
    "80BF5C9C": "I believe that was meant to be a rhetorical statement.",
    "80BF5D50": "Yeah. Anyway, we're bringing it in.",
    "80BF5D55": "I look forward to your arrival.",
    "80BD1CED": "Watch out!",
    "80BF5D60": "I can't believe that Captain's still ahead of us. He's much cleverer than most of the Captains we've met.",
    "80BF5D62": "Well, I say, 'Met,' but you know what I mean.",
    "80BF5D64": "This Captain gave us a good run for it. Not a lot like him out there.",
    "80BF5D66": "Let's get Sloane her reactor.",
    "80FF55F8": "[Fallen speech]",
    "80BF5D82": "Sloane, why do the Fallen want the reactor?",
    "80BF5D84": "For Ether production, probably. They hook up a big Servitor to it, they double or triple output. Why do you ask?",
    "80BF5D86": "No reason.",
    "80BF5D9F": "This Captain's just full of surprises. Nasty ones.",
    "80BF5DAA": "Remind me, do we like the Hive or Fallen better?",
    "80BD1D03": "Ouch. That had to hurt.",
    "80BD1D05": "Thanks to you, the reactor is online and we know just where it is. Dropping coordinates now.",
    "80BD1D07": "The problem is that Fallen Captain. He's been one step ahead of us this whole time.",
    "80BD1D09": "So we do this fast. We've got this, Commander.",
    "80BF5DAC": "Sloane, you'll never guess what happened.",
    "80BF5DAE": "You... killed a Captain and found a methane reactor?",
    "80BF5DBD": "We didn't kill him. He let us have it. Just looked at us and left.",
    "80BF5DBF": "Fascinating! I believe you. This is an excellent reminder that the universe is ... a complicated place.",
    "80BF5DC1": "That perhaps there are more things in the heavens than can be dreamt of in our philosophy. At any rate. Bring in your prize, Guardian.",
    "80BF5DC3": "I think that Captain just gave us the reactor.",
    "80BF5DC5": "You think you understand the Fallen, and then...",
    "80BF5DC8": "Well, let's take it. Sloane's waiting.",
    "80BF5DCA": "Circuit breaker's going to be around there somewhere. Find it and flip the switch. Just like I said.",
    "80BF5DD9": "Yeah! Power's back! ",
    "80BF5E0A": "Exemplary work, everyone. ",
    "80BF5E36": "But we still have to deal with these intercepted enemy transmissions. ",
    "80BF5E38": "Something went wrong. Pistons must be jammed.",
    "80BF5E3A": "Sorry, pal, but you're gonna have to go out there, rig a workaround.",
    "80BF5E3C": "Did you hear that?",
    "80BF5E3E": "Looks fragile.",
    "80BF5E40": "We made it to the converter platforms.",
    "80BF5E42": "OK. Get to the stalled pistons, see what's jamming 'em. Once they're all moving, we're in business.",
    "80BF5E44": "Sloane, Amanda. The Hive have infected everything.",
    "80BF5E46": "Holliday, we gotta get you back in the air. We'll need ongoing aerial threat assessments to keep our perimeter secure.",
    "80BF5E48": "Oh, uh",
    "80BF5E4A": "Yeah, you know my ship took a beating during the evacuation. ",
    "80BF5E4C": "I'll bump you to the front of the line for repairs once the lights are back on.",
    "80BF5E4E": "Great. Great.",
    "80BF5E50": "We should get this converter working before we move on.",
    "80BF5E52": "Let's go! More forward motion!",
    "80BF5E54": "Accessing systems now.",
    "80BF5E56": "Final piston is clear. ",
    "80BF5F1E": "Control Center's still dark. So it's gotta be more than a piston problem. Gonna have to get in, futz with the circuit breakers.",
    "80BF5F6C": "Try the Central Platform. Everything routes through there.",
    "80BD1D71": "All right, we're not out of this yet.",
    "80BD1D73": "Now that we've reached the Control Center, we still need to power up the place before we can take care of our Fleet. ",
    "80BD1D75": "Commander Zavala tells me you've volunteered.",
    "80BD1D77": "I'll run tactical. Shipwright Holliday here will provide tech support. It's a straightforward op: get in, flip a switch, get out. ",
    "80BD1D79": "Heh. Sloane's got a way of making things sound easy, doesn't she?",
    "80C12077": "Every night since we got here, I feel like that's all we've heard.",
    "80C12660": "Focus on the mission, people. We can talk about our nightmares another time. ",
    "80C1266C": "Or we can just keep living this one. ",
    "80C1266E": "We can see the wave energy converters from here.",
    "80C12670": "Sweet. Now just flip the switch and turn ‘em on.",
    "80C12672": "First piston's good to go. We gave it a power-scrubbing.",
    "80C12674": "That's great and all, but, uh... It's still pretty dark on this end.",
    "80C1268E": "Sounds like you got more scrubbing to do, Guardian. ",
    "80C12690": "Oh yeah, found the problem. The Hive have gunked up the pistons.",
    "80C12692": "Then let's find a fix.",
    "80C12694": "Ugh. Some of the pistons are moving, but we're still sitting in the dark.",
    "80C12696": "Did we lead the Fallen here?",
    "80C12698": "No. Those vultures have been following us since we evacuated Earth.",
    "80C1269A": "We got the CPU, but we stirred up the entire Hive colony -- and it’s a long walk to the surface. ",
    "80C1269C": "They're not gonna make it out of there, Commander.",
    "80C1269E": "Guardian.... Can you make it to the Center of the Arcology? We should be able to send someone to pick you up from there.",
    "80C126A0": "Holliday? ",
    "80C126A2": "Yeah ... yeah, I’m on it. ",
    "80C126A4": "Got eyes on ya', pal! Meet you at the end of the road!",
    "80C126A6": "Good work -- both of you. ",
    "80C126A8": "Let’s get that CPU back to Control and decrypt these transmissions. ",
    "80C12B2B": "Things may finally be looking up for us. ",
    "80C12B2D": "Ram the door! Ram everything!",
    "80C12D7D": "The CPU network is deep in the maintenance levels. Amanda, is this what we're looking for?",
    "80C12D80": "Bingo! That's the place!",
    "80C12D82": "Okay, I've got the location. Let's find a way down.",
    "80BD1DE7": "Holliday has detected an unusual amount of electricity being re-directed into the Arcology.",
    "80BD1DE9": "Yep. Juice like that can only mean one thing: a network of CPU's—powerful ones.",
    "80BD1DEB": "Maybe powerful enough to decrypt that Cabal signal we intercepted.",
    "80BD1DED": "Unfortunately, we don't know where the network might be located.",
    "80BD1DEF": "So you're gonna have to snoop around, not draw too much attention.",
    "80BD1DF3": "Guardian, securing this asset could turn the tide of this 'war' with the Red Legion. Without it",
    "80BD1DF5": "I don't know what comes next.",
    "80C12D84": "We're definitely in Hive territory now.",
    "80C12D86": "Indeed. ",
    "80C12D88": "Keep radio chatter to a minimum. We don't want to draw any unnecessary attention.",
    "80C12D8A": "Over there. One of the access terminals we're looking for.",
    "80C12D8C": "Looks like the Hive dug a short cut for us. Let's head down that hole in the ground.",
    "80C12D8E": "This road leads to the center of the Arcology. We'll need a way out once we get there.",
    "80C12D90": "I'm strapping in and about to take off. I'll be there AY-SAP.",
    "80C12D92": "Amanda!",
    "80C12D94": "Sir?",
    "80C12D96": "Fly fast. Fly safe.",
    "80C12D98": "Yes Sir!",
    "80C12D9A": "Warning. CPU network disrupted. ",
    "80C12D9C": "Well, there's no way the Hive didn't hear that alarm.",
    "80C12D9E": "Move it, Guardian!",
    "80C12DA0": "Up ahead. That elevator shaft will lead us straight to—an Ogre.",
    "80C12DA2": "Looks like the Fallen were trying to break through those tiles.",
    "80C12DA4": "Welcome to New Pacific Arcology, the bright future of space colonization in the shadow of Saturn. ",
    "80C12DA6": "Sounds like the Arcology's operating system is back online.",
    "80C12DA8": "I knew it! Keep an eye out for an OS access terminal. You can use it to pinpoint the CPU network.",
    "80C12DAA": "Local officials will neither confirm nor deny the existence of any so-called deep-space anomaly. ",
    "80C12DAC": "Thirty-four percent of Titan’s citizens hope the Traveler will terraform the ocean-moon soon. ",
    "80C12DAE": "The Traveler’s sudden departure from Io was a surprise to many but experts insist we should trust in the Traveler’s choices. ",
    "80C12DB0": "Attention science lovers! The Collective’s lecture on the terraforming of Io begins in five minutes in the Cassini Library.",
    "80C12DB2": "The New Pacific Academy is proud to offer degrees in Methane-Oceanography and Tidal Engineering.",
    "80C12DB4": "We made it, Sloane.",
    "80C12DB6": "Perfect. Recon the perimeter before you move on the Control Center.",
    "80C12DB8": "Sloane. Commander. It's done.",
    "80C12DBA": "Copy that. Zavala and I are inbound.",
    "80C12DBC": "We cleared the nest. Heading to the Control Center now.",
    "80C12DBE": "Well done. Sweep the perimeter, and we'll move in on your signal.",
    "80C12DC0": "Commander, we're here to help.",
    "80C12DC2": "No! We've already lost too many Lightless Guardians to the Hive. We can't secure this moon.",
    "80C12DC4": "We have our Light back. ",
    "80C12DC6": "What? Impossible.",
    "80C12DC8": "Commander, if I may? ",
    "80C12DCA": "Guardian, this is Deputy Commander Sloane.",
    "80C12DCC": "We have a counteroffensive to plan. To do that, we need to get this station up and running. ",
    "80C12DCE": "There's a fleet to prep, Guardians to arm, and a trove of intercepted Red Legion transmissions to decrypt.",
    "80C12DD0": "It’s critical we gain access to the station’s Control Center. That’s where you come in.",
    "80C12DD2": "If the Light really is with you, send the Hive back to hell. ",
    "80C12DD4": "And Guardian Please. Be careful.",
    "80C12DD6": "Shoot the yellow sacs.",
    "80C12DD8": "What was this place?",
    "80C12DDA": "The Golden Age cities of Titan were once the pride of humanity.",
    "80C12DDC": "We thought they were abandoned.",
    "80C12DDE": "But I was a fool to think the Hive would not spread this far.",
    "80C12DE0": "And with the Light on our side, we can build a counteroffensive and take back our City.",
    "80C12DE2": "Go on, shoot it!",
    "80C12DE4": "I shudder to think what spell the Hive were casting back there. ",
    "80C12DE6": "We should talk to Eris Morn. She would know which Hive god they were communing with.",
    "80C12DE8": "No one has seen Eris—or Ikora or Cayde—since The City fell.",
    "80C12DEA": "It looked like the Hive were performing some kind of ritual.",
    "80C12DEC": "We should talk to Ikora. She knows all there is to know about Hive magic.",
    "80C12DEE": "No one has seen Ikora or Cayde since the City fell.",
    "80C12DF0": "So it looks like we’re standing in some kind of Hive breeding ground.",
    "80C12DF2": "Take it out.",
    "80C12DF4": "There's the Control Center!",
    "80C12DF6": "Clear the area so we can move in.  ",
    "80C12DF8": "I have a bad feeling about this",
    "80C12DFA": "We're approaching the landing platform. Get up here, and take a bow.",
    "80C12DFC": "OK, Sloane. We can see the Control Center.",
    "80C12DFE": "Copy that. Keep pushing forward. ",
    "80C12E00": "Commander. At this rate, we can start planning our counteroffensive. We’ll be outside the City gates in no time.",
    "80C12E02": "Hmm. If it were only that simple.",
    "80C12E04": "Hawthorne already believes Zavala abandoned her and the survivors. Now that we’re leaving",
    "80C12E06": "If we stayed, yes, we could help them survive, but",
    "80C12E08": "…If Zavala really is building a counteroffensive on Titan, we can save them all—and take back the City.  ",
    "80C12E0A": "Dead end. Unless we do something about that fan.",
    "80C12E0C": "Hey! I was just thinking about you.",
    "80C12E0E": "Good to see you.",

    "80C12E16": "You worked hard for this. Enjoy it.",
    "80C12E18": "You earned it.",
    "80C12E1A": "Got a situation here.",
    "80C12E1C": "Mission on deck, Guardian.",

    "80C12E22": "I need your help with something.",
    "80C12E24": "Was just thinking about you. Mission on deck.",
    "80C12E26": "I'm planning an operation here, and I need you involved.",
    "80FF568C": "Guardian? Are you okay?",
    "80FF568D": "Recently had a particularly close encounter with the Hive. Could've been much worse.",
    "80FF568E": "Sometimes it gets to me just staring out at the ocean. Sure, we're outside. But the cabin fever still sets in when you can't go very far.",
    "80FF568F": "I've got something exciting in the works. Can't talk about it just yet, but the Hive are not going to be happy.",
    "80FF5690": "Don't just stand there. The Hive'll get you.",
    "80FF5691": "If you have nothing to say, I've got a lot to do.",
    "80FF5693": "Plenty of things to do here, Guardian. Do you need a task?",
    "80FF5695": "I'm incredibly proud of what the fleet represents. Do you have any idea how many people we got out of the City?",
    "80FF5697": "I've been thinking about what our ancestors meant to do out here. Was making this facility a statement? Or just the 'next step?'",
    "80FF5699": "I mean, the old man likes to go on and on and on about how the Titans built the Walls. And we did, of course, but—between you and me—we had a lot of help.",
    "80FF569B": "I fought in every major battle the City ever saw. And they were nothing compared to the Legion's assault. I still can't believe it.",
    "80FF569D": "Since the moment my Ghost got me on my feet, I've wanted to serve. Being out here with the fleet well, it fills me with a lot of pride. I hope you feel the same way.",
    "80FF569F": "No, I've fought Hive before. These things are they're different somehow. Something about the eyes. It sets my teeth on edge.",
    "80FF56A1": "When you're deep in Hive territory, don't forget to look up. Nobody ever remembers to look up.",
    "80FF56A3": "You probably think I’m slow because I’m old but— ah, you know what? Stow your answer before we both regret it.",
    "80FF56A5": "Don't call Zavala 'old man' to his face. I had to earn that, and you haven't been around long enough.",
    "80FF56A7": "I wonder how busy Zavala is these days",
    "80FF56A8": "Maybe I should see what Amanda is up to",
    "80FF56A9": "May you find good fortune in the coming year, Guardian. Unless we're competing against each other. I'll take all the good fortune in that case.",
    "80FF56AA": "Still trying to find the perfect gift for Zavala. He's impossible to shop for.",
    "80FF56AB": "So Mara Sov's back?  What is going on with the Awoken?",
    "80FF56AC": "When do you head back to the Dreaming City?",
    "80FF56AD": "If anybody can help the Awoken, it's you.",
    "80FF56AE": "I'm sorry about Cayde he was an irreplaceable member of the Vanguard.",
    "80FF56AF": "Cayde's death weighs heavily on Zavala, whether he shows it or not.",
    "80FF56B0": "Every one of us reaches a point where we have to decide what kind of Guardian we're going to be. Don't let it pass you by.",
    "80FF56B1": "We all thought the next threat would come from the out, not from within. Zavala well, he's hard on himself. ",
    "80FF56B2": "The solar system's a lot more complicated than it was back when we built the City's walls. That's not a bad thing. Just the way it is. ",
    "80FF56B3": "Taking down our enemies is the job, but killing one of our own? I'm not sure that's a line I could cross.",
    "80F1F291": "I'm glad we have Hunters like you for the long patrols. Makes me feel better.",
    "80F1F293": "Ah. Don't those cloaks start to get—I don't know—heavy after a while?",
    "80F1F295": "Titan, you and me — we're going to make the old man proud. ",
    "80F1F297": "People always think we Titans are just one-track-mind punching machines. And that's just not true! Sometimes we shoot things.",
    "80F1F299": "Titan, don't ever listen if they tell you not to jump. Always, always jump. ",
    "80F1F29B": "I'm glad we have Warlocks like you out here. Hive magic is well, it's beyond me.",
    "80F1F29D": "Ahh. I need to work on meditation. You Warlocks make it look so easy. I can't get my mind to shut up, you know?",
    "80F1F29F": "Listen, I've known Ikora practically forever. If you ever want to hear a good story, ask her about her 'book club.' And be ready to duck.",
    "80FF56B4": "Perfect timing. The Hive are making another stand.",
    "80FF56B5": "Come to help fight some more Hive? They're not gonna be happy to hear you're back.",
    "80FF56B6": "Guns at the ready. Let's move.",
    "80FF56B7": "Siren's Watch is overrun again.",
    "80FF56B8": "Perfect timing. We needed you.",

    "80FF56BB": "Talk to me.",
    "80FF56BD": "Eyes on me.",
    "80FF56BF": "Let's get moving.",
    "80FF56C1": "Talk fast. Got a lot on my plate.",
    "80FF56C3": "Good to go?",
    "80FF56C5": "I always get flustered around this time of year. Finding a partner isn't so easy for everyone.",

    "80FF56C8": "The Dawning's the perfect time to show what we're made of. Tell me you're participating?",

    "80BF42A7": "Nope. Same plan. Give Sloane my regards.",
    "80BF42AB": "These are all Guardians...",
    "80BF42AF": "Operation Caliban online. Guardians, you're here for a top-priority extraction. We have multiple fireteams missing.",
    "80BF42B0": "They went into the Arcology to investigate a heavily-guarded Hive ritual. We've had zero contact for the last several hours. Which is why we need you.",
    "80BF42B1": "Operation Caliban, welcome to the show. We've got several fireteams missing beneath the Arcology. We got one report a few hours back, but it's been radio silence since then.",
    "80BF42B2": "This is combat search and rescue in extremely hostile territory. The Hive are notorious for their cruelty. Expect the worst.",
    "80BF42B3": "Those Guardians are my responsibility. Get in, get out, and don't die.",
    "80BF42B4": "This is a priority rescue mission, designated ID: Operation Caliban.",
    "80BF42B5": "Four hours ago, I sent several fireteams to investigate a Hive ritual deep in the Arcology. Something severed our comms. They've gone completely dark.",
    "80BF42B6": "Bring them home.",
    "80BF487A": "Nothing survives the Gauntlet. But it will entertain us to see you try.",
    "80BF487E": "Enter the Gauntlet. You’re the evening’s entertainment. *laughs*",
    "80BF4880": "Impress me, and I will show you the path to true power.",
    "80BF4882": "Amuse me, Traveler-spawn. *laughs*",
    "80BF4884": "You're tense.  Why don't you relax in the baths? Join my soldiers in their revelry. They won't mind.",
    "80BF4886": "My soldiers use the baths for recreation and recuperation. I'm sure they'll welcome you.",
    "80BF4888": "The royal nectar of the baths enhances the bodies and minds of every soldier on this ship. You should partake. *laughs*",
    "80BF488A": "Come to my chamber.  Let us drink together.",
    "80BF488C": "You are far more entertaining than I had anticipated—meet with me in person.",
    "80BF488E": "Come! You deserve an audience with me. I will show you true power.",
    "80BF4890": "If you seek the means to live to your potential, I can guide you to it. ",
    "80BF4892": "There is power in this universe beyond your feeble Light.",
    "80BF4894": "I leave you with those words, and these parting gifts. Take them, and grow fat from strength. Emperor Calus has spoken.",
    "80BF4896": "Everything you know is a lie. There is a truth beyond what your people and your Speaker have told you.",
    "80BF4898": "I can take you to that truth, if you seek me out. These gifts are a reminder of my words. ",
    "80BF489A": "Emperor Calus has spoken.",
    "80BF489C": "Now you’ve seen everything. ",
    "80BF489E": "Do you still believe you’re on the right side? Mull it over, and enjoy my gifts to you.",
    "80BF48A0": "I possess the means to true agency beyond your feeble Light. Seek me out, and perhaps I’ll show you how to grow fat from strength.",
    "80BF48A2": "Relish the gardens. If you don't stop to enjoy the small things in life, you diminish the crucial moments.",
    "80BF48A4": "The gardens contain the floral emblem of the empire—the plants from which we derive royal nectar. Enjoy them.",
    "80BF48A6": "The gardens are beautiful, but watch your step. You never know where a beast might lurk.",
    "80BF48A8": "*boisterous laughter*",
    "80BF48AA": "*boisterous laughter*",
    "80BF48AC": "*boisterous laughter*",
    "80BF48AE": "Are you thirsty? Can I get you something to drink?",
    "80BF48B0": "Can my servants fetch you a beverage? I suppose you’ve killed most of them. *laughs*",
    "80BF48B2": "You look even smaller in person. *laughs*",
    "80BF48B4": "There is beauty to your Light. Let me admire it up close.",
    "80BF48B6": "Prove yourself worthy, and I will grant you the means to true power.",
    "80BF48B8": "You've accepted my challenge. Good! I would be pleased to see what your Light can do.",
    "80BF48BA": "This vessel will challenge you in ways you have never dreamed. Let’s enjoy ourselves.",
    "80BF48BC": "You fight with passion! Good! *laughs*",
    "80BF48BE": "*laughs* Defiant till the end! Magnificent!",
    "80BF48C0": "What strength! *laughs*",
    "80C13047": "Hey, you probably wanna hustle. I think they just said something about ripping my beautiful horn off my face? My beautiful, beautiful horn.",
    "80C13049": "Then again, my Eliksni is pretty rusty. ",
    "80C1304B": "The Gate Lord’s down. Hold on, Cayde, we’re on our way.",
    "80C1304D": "Uh, that's good to hear, 'cause the Fallen just found us. ",
    "80C1304F": "Activating defensive shield. The Cayde-6 must stand back.",
    "80C13051": "Hey, nice one, Failsafe! The Fallen can≐t get to us now! ",
    "80C13053": "Please proceed through the nearby Vex gate.",
    "80C13055": "I was hoping the Fallen and Vex would finish each other off on Venus.",
    "80C13057": "Is it too much to hope that the Vex and Fallen finish each other off?",
    "80C13059": "But then you’d miss all the fun!",
    "80C1305B": "Hey! That Fallen dropped something!",
    "80C1305D": "New captain registered. Welcome aboard, Captain!",
    "80C1305F": "Seems like you need to pick that up. I’d do it, but no hands.",
    "80C13061": "Did that work?",
    "80C13063": "Intruder alert!",
    "80C13065": "It’s me! It’s— It's 'the Cayde Unit'?",
    "80C13067": "False. I mean, true. But you are attracting large numbers of Fallen to my position. ",
    "80C13069": "Dagnabbit! Failsafe, they’re shootin' at me!",
    "80C1306B": "Then I advise you not get shot.",
    "80C1306D": "That is a really big Vex.",
    "80C1306F": "What could have possibly brought Cayde to Nessus?",
    "80C13071": "I know the answer!",
    "80C13073": "One: stop listening in on us. Two: what’s the answer? ",
    "80C13075": "He asked me not to tell anyone!",
    "80C13077": "Uh oh. The Fallen’s got the Vex in a tizzy, and by tizzy I mean murderous rampage. ",
    "80C13079": "I'll hunker down in the Exodus Black.",
    "80C1307B": "Here? But my hull is in 108 pieces. Decks 1 through 20 are buried. And my coolant system—",
    "80C1307D": "I am a mess.",
    "80C1307F": "Oh, we know, Failsafe. We know.",
    "80C13081": "I thought your wholesale destruction of the Vex would make me miss my captain and crew less.",
    "80C13083": "Did it?",
    "80C13085": "It did not.",
    "80C13087": "Warning! Vex threat detected! They are blocking your path to the Cayde unit’s teleporter",
    "80C13089": "You will have to eliminate them.",
    "80C1308B": "Seems like you met my new friends, Failsafe and her evil twin, Failsafe.",
    "80C1308D": "Which is the evil one?",
    "80C1308F": "If I had feelings, they would be hurt!",
    "80C13091": "Guys, we’re blocked! The Vex put up a barrier!",
    "80C13093": "I know how to disable that barrier!",
    "80C13095": "The big Vex. Smash it.",
    "80C13097": "Intruder alert!",
    "80C13099": "Ugh. IT’S US!",
    "80BF4920": "Failsafe: we're at your coordinates. Cayde is stuck inside a Vex portal system. Can you help us find the power source so we can get him out?",
    "80BF4921": "Oh yes! By locating the original Vex Teleporter the Cayde Unit used, you can shut down the loop and free him. I can guide you there.",
    "80BF4922": "OK. So we find this Vex teleporter and shut it down. Easy.",
    "80C1309E": "This is the Vex teleporter?",
    "80C130A0": "Yes! The Cayde-6 will want it. You should pick it up!",
    "80BF4925": "Ew. This looks like the stuff inside the Vex.",
    "80BF4926": "It’s called Radiolaria. You know, mind fluid!",
    "80BF4927": "Ikora says it’s an organic compound. Which means the Vex are not pure robot.",
    "80BF4928": "Yecch! What is this stuff?",
    "80BF4929": "It’s called Radiolaria. You know, Vex mind fluid!",
    "80BF492A": "Hmm. This stuff is organic. Seems the Vex are not pure robot",
    "80C130A8": "You have saved us! Updating my crew log.",
    "80C130AA": "The Vex teleporter is behind this energy barrier!",
    "80C130AC": "Let’s go find Cayde.",
    "80C130AE": "Take that, you scrap heap! I’m out, baby! Out! Woo! ",
    "80C130B0": "Cayde! Where are you?",
    "80C130B2": "Hey! You did it! You got me out! Ha! HahaAnd wh-where— where am I? ",
    "80C130B4": "Cayde Unit, you are near the remains of my reactor core. Welcome to the Exodus Black. ",
    "80C130B6": "Where all your dreams come true. ",
    "80C130C2": "You won't escape me again!",
    "80C130C4": "It's closed. I'll get the barrier down again.",
    "80C130C6": "Hold them off! The barrier's back up.",
    "80C130C8": "Missed it. I'll drop the power again!",
    "80C130CA": "Too slow, Fancy-pants! But I can get the barrier down again.",
    "80C130CC": "I feel like we had a moment here. But then you kept standing here, and the moment went on too long, and now Yeah, it's gone. ",
    "80C130CE": "Into the void!",

    "80C130DC": "Get moving! That thing will close on you!",
    "80C130DE": "Move, before the barrier comes back up!",
    "80C130E0": "I can't keep the barrier down much longer! Go!",
    "80C130E2": "What was that?",
    "80C130E4": "We cleared a path for you! Keep moving!",
    "80C130E6": "Eh, I was tired of that arm anyway. Next one? Built-in rocket launcher!",
    "80C130E8": "You've got this.",

    "80C13165": "A little longer, Cayde. We're almost there! ",
    "80C13167": "I pity you.",

    "80C131AD": "A robotic alien entity called the Vex have achieved 92.014 percent conversion of the Centaur Nessus. ",
    "80C131AF": "How long have you been here, exactly?",
    "80C131B1": "Long enough to see the Vex convert this entire planetoid, kill all living organisms, reformat molecules, and digitize brain waves for further study. It’s a fascinating process!",
    "80C131B3": "She sounds way too excited about that.",
    "80BF4AB1": "Like, I don’t know. Leaving?",
    "80BF4AB3": "Or, you know, whatever. I have nothing better to do.",

    "80BF4ACF": "Yeah are you OK? You sound a little off.",
    "80BF4AD1": "I am the Exodus Black’s failsafe. Call me Failsafe! I boosted the Cayde-6’s signal in hopes he would be rescued. And look! Here you are!",
    "80BF4AD3": "Oh, I see! She’s just an AI. A malfunctioning AI.",

    "80BF4AE3": "In over my head Vex trap Failsafe?",
    "80BF4AE5": "VEX TRAP?! What is Cayde getting us into this time?",
    "80BF4AE7": "A signal, a Vex trap, and a failsafe. Sounds like the beginning of a typical Cayde joke. ",
    "80BF4AE9": "Something around here is blasting that signal into space. We find that something, we’ll find Cayde.",
    "80C131CB": "Cayde did say something about a 'trap.'",
    "80C131CD": "What’s that? That a Hydra? OK, yeah, yeah—no, handle that first. Then me!",
    "80BF4AEF": "Commander Zavala needs the Vanguard united again. ",
    "80BF4AF1": "While he prepares for the assault on the Almighty, we’re going to find Cayde and Ikora.",
    "80BF4AF3": "Luckily, we picked up an odd signal from Cayde’s Ghost. It’s being boosted somehow from a 'centaur' called Nessus.",
    "80BF4AF5": "Which is strange. Centaurs are really just big rocks in the outer reaches of the Solar System. There should be nothing there...",
    "80C131CF": "That is so Cayde.",
    "80C131D1": "Kind of",
    "80C131D3": "Keep it up! Unless you’re losing, then—DO BETTER!",
    "80C131D5": "It is perfectly safe!",
    "80C131D7": "Hey, did you get it? Spinning around so much, I’m trying—oh—I'm trying not to throw up in here!",
    "80C131DA": "'All I ask is you return to my loving embrace.' Ew. 'Emperor Calus has spoken.'",
    "80C131DC": "Whoa. Wait. Emperor? As in Cabal Emperor? OK, opulence later. Ikora now. Ikora! Uh, great job today, guys.",
    "80C131DE": "Boy, he left in a hurry. I wonder what that was about? ",
    "80C131E0": "I'm in! This gets weirder They've analyzed the planetoid soil and what might happen if it's combined with something called 'Royal Nectar.' One more cluster.",
    "80C131E2": "It's more environmental data. Just some logistical planning so they can prime their ship to... 'eat the planet.' This new Cabal leader might have a few screws loose.",
    "80C131E4": "I mean, they don't have a ship that big! Do they?",
    "80C131E6": "It's more environmental data. Just some logistical planning so they can prime their ship to...'eat the planet.' This new Cabal leader might have a few screws loose.",
    "80C131E8": "The Legion is pulling schematics of Nessus itself from the Confluxes! Atmospheric, geologic, and tectonic data. They want it all. I'm not sure why.",
    "80C131EA": "Okay, I'm going to read this and you pretend like I understand. The Cabal want to grind Nessus into 'glorious dust, fit for royalty.' ",
    "80C131EC": "Okay, this might explain it. Let's see... The Legion is helping their unnamed leader identify mineral-rich deposits on Nessus forconsumption. Well, that can't be right.",
    "80F5C3B4": "I grabbed everything I could, and shut down the Confluxes. The Red Legion won't get any of the data this new leader wanted them to secure.",
    "80C131EE": "They're gonna be so mad. I love it!",
    "80C131F0": "Serves them right! Let's get this to the Vanguard before I have to defrag. The Legion wanted every byte of data the Vex have on Nessus.",
    "80C131F2": "Transmitting now. Cayde! I'm picking up a planet-wide broadcast.",
    "80C131F4": "'Red Legion 7th Company has failed to secure Vex data. Their invitation to join the Loyalist regime is hereby rescinded.'",
    "80C131F6": "There's more. 'The rest of you still have a chance to prove yourselves. I offer you a life of... opulence?'",
    "80C131F8": "Opulence? Oh, I could go for some opulence right now.",
    "80BF4B39": "Hey you two. My scouts picked up a weird Cabal signal coming from a ship that's definitely not Red Legion. Some new guy giving orders. He's got the Red Legion running around like errand boys on Nessus.",
    "80BF4B3B": "Last time the Cabal had a management shakeup, they burned down our house. Let's see what they're up to. Bring guns.",
    "80BF4B3D": "Well, we always have at least three.",
    "80C131FA": "Great work! Both Confluxes linked! Just keep them away while I read this recipe for converting Nessus soil into a purified 'Royal Wine.' What are the Cabal doing?",
    "80BF4B5C": "Hello! Materials analysis requested. Odds of success are very high, given the 5,387 variables I am currently tracking.",
    "80BF4B5E": "Captain, acquisition of materials could yield insights into the local environment. Manifest attached.",
    "80BF4B60": "Dear Captain, analysis of listed supplies may be crucial to ongoing operations. Suggest you acquire them at your own pace.",
    "80BF4B62": "Hmm. Detecting a unique opportunity for exotic materials analysis. At the very least, it will give me something to pass the time.",
    "80BF4B64": "Cayde has requested assistance with the attached manifest. Perhaps I should update your status from captain to courier?",
    "80BF4B66": "Oh, hello! There is a weakness in a localized subsystem. Acquire supplies, and we may discover a way to exploit this.",
    "80BF4B68": "Oh, Captain? I'm detecting unknown hostiles carrying unknown technology. Location unknown.",
    "80BF4B6A": "Friends, I have numerous systems in need of repair. Suggest course of action: acquire components for analysis.",
    "80BF4B6C": "As an alternative to more chess, suggest acquistion of attached supplies for analysis.",
    "80BF4B6E": "Hey, so it gets pretty boring around here? If you pick up some stuff on this list, it'd give me something to do.",
    "80BF4B9D": "Friends, I'm tracking a marked increase in the frequency of enemy patrols. Suggest cessation of life functions in the following units.",
    "80BF4B9F": "Enemy patrol has dispersed in several directions. I calculate reducing its numbers further could see the unit rout.",
    "80BF4BA1": "Cayde, using roguish charm to secure my assistance, has requested a reduction in enemy numbers.",
    "80BF4BA3": "Oh Captain? Fireteams nearby report massing enemy units. Suggest a substantial reduction, with details attached.",
    "80BF4BA5": "Dear Captain, I detect the enemy massing. Recommend immediate action to prevent threat escalation.",
    "80BF4BA7": "Enemy build-up identified, Captain. Threat levels have increased by at least ten percent. Elimination of hostiles advised. ",
    "80BF4BA9": "Captain, hostile targets identified. Their elimination would make the area 21.3 percent safer.",
    "80BF4BAB": "Targets identified! They would seem to threaten our continued operations here. Very definitely recommend destroying them!",
    "80BF4BAD": "Friends, there are enemies in transit within your sector. Calculating optimal casualties to disrupt their operations. ",
    "80BF4BAF": "Key enemy targets identified within your sector, Captain. ",
    "80BF4BB1": "I'm tracking some things? And they're gross. Can you wipe them out? Then I won't have to track them anymore. Thanks.",
    "80BF4BB3": "Cayde's been sending me messages like 'dangerous patrol' and 'critical strike', so I guess you're supposed to take these things out? Or  whatever.",
    "80BF4BE0": "Hey friends! I'm having a devil of a time getting some data we need. Can you initiate a manual scan?",
    "80BF4BE2": "Captain? I'm getting irregular signals over here. An on-site scan sure would make me a heck of a lot less nervous.",
    "80BF4BE4": "Close-range scans at key junctions points could be crucial to our success. And I have precisely zero limbs with which to aid me.",
    "80BF4BE6": "Captain, I'm attempting to generate a detailed report on sector 02249. An on-site scan would make this go ever-so-much faster.",
    "80BF4BE8": "Friends, there are many things I am good at. Chess, conversation  math. But I cannot initiate a short-range scan at this locale. Could you assist me?",
    "80BF4BEA": "I believe there is something of interest at this locale. A scan would allow us to make that determination. Or if more chess is in order.",
    "80BF4BEC": "Possible system weakness detected at this coordinate. Probability of hack without manual scan, zero percent. Probability with manual scan, 97 percent. If you would, Captain?",
    "80BF4BEE": "Scanning localized phenomenon with the sensor array I currently have online is ill-advised. Assuming you are a fan of your skin, which seems like a safe assumption.",
    "80BF4BF0": "I am detecting unique localized power fluctuations. Scans will allow for more precise understanding and spark conversation next time we meet.",
    "80BF4BF2": "Hey. Go here. Scan this. Brighten up a lady's day.",
    "80BF4C09": "Friends, we could use some robust sensor data. Acquistion would open a number of doors. And make me happy. ",
    "80BF4C0D": "There's something at this location, Captain. Survey data will assist us in determining a course of action. ",
    "80BF4C0F": "Interesting! Strange energy spikes and exotic data may be present at this locale. Survey data can offer us insight.",
    "80BF4C11": "Captain, please survey the area at these coordinates. This data may open new avenues of exploration across the planet's surface.",
    "80BF4C13": "Compromised databanks do not cover the listed area of this planet, Captain. Suggest sending me a survey of the area.",
    "80BF4C15": "Friends, I'd like to request reconnaissance from the following area. I can assure you my simulation of gratitude will be quite convincing!",
    "80BF4C17": "I'm sending you coordinates for some place to survey. Probably crawling with bad guys. But I'm pretty bored",
    "80BF4C19": "There's a lot of gaps in my sensor net, I guess. Survey over here and try not to get like  splattered.",
    "80BF4C5C": "Captain, I'm detecting an enemy commander of impressive size. Removing it from the battlefield would be highly advisable!",
    "80BF4C5E": "Captain, I recommend dealing with this priority target. You could attempt a diplomatic solution, but the statistical likelihood of success there is very low.",
    "80BF4C60": "Friends, the elimination of this target will fulfill two criteria. First, it will significantly diminish enemy efficacy in the area. Second, it will be fun.",
    "80BF4C62": "Detailing an enemy combatant of significant import. If I may, swift and decisive action is recommended.",
    "80BF4C64": "The profile I am compiling indicates you have an affection for challenging combat situations. Good luck! And do not die!",
    "80BF4C66": "I don't want to overly worry you. But there's an enemy commander massing a force that could overrun us and threaten all we stand for. Suggest taking it out?",
    "80BF4C68": "Analysis of enemy deployment has yielded a priority target. It is rather large and ill-tempered! Do not be alarmed—I believe you can take it.",
    "80BF4C6A": "So, this thing is some kind of general. Taking it out would probably be you know. Good.",
    "80C13206": "We're in! I've never done a prison break before!",
    "80C13208": "Good luck, Captain!",
    "80C1320A": "There sure are a lot of Fallen down here. I'm picking up barriers ahead, and below us. Deep below us.",
    "80C1320C": "Captain, that could mean more prisoners! You should free them!",
    "80C1320E": "Failsafe, they tried to kill us.",
    "80C13210": "Better that than dying in a cage.",
    "80C13212": "Captain: the Vex Collective is sending a response to your prison break!",
    "80C13214": "Hah. Too late to stop us. If it's a fight they want",
    "80C13216": "All clear! Not a single Vex, or Fallen in sight. I'm sorry it had to end this way, Failsafe.",
    "80C13218": "The attempt was appreciated, friendly Ghost.",
    "80C1321A": "They've taken—wow—a lot of Fallen. This is just the tip of the facility. This group was told they could 'terminate each other' and the survivor would be set free.",
    "80C1321C": "None of them fired a shot. Except at us, I mean. Gotta admire that loyalty.",
    "80C1321E": "We all learned something today.",
    "80C13220": "Yeah. The Vex are the worst.",
    "80BF4C8F": "Captain. The Vex appear to be capturing Fallen. I have traced a high number of prisoners to a cave near your location.",
    "80BF4C91": "Imprisonment by the Vex is not a fate I would wish on anyone! Perhaps we can help.",
    "80BF4C93": "Failsafe, just so you know, the Fallen probably won't thank us for helping them.",
    "80BF4C95": "Trust me. Either way, you'll be doing them a favor.",
    "80BF4C98": "Guardian, there's a cloaked Fallen in your vicinity. Neutralize it, we need to confirm a theory.",
    "80C13222": "I… wow.",
    "80C13224": "'Wow' is not a helpful term on the battlefield, Ghost.",
    "80C13226": "So the Fallen signal is coming from behind a massive barrier powered by Vex tech. Looks like they've stolen themselves a toy.",
    "80C13228": "All right, I think we've got this taken care of. That Fallen crew won't be bothering you anymore, Failsafe.",
    "80C1322A": "Good work. All of you.",
    "80C1322C": "You have my thanks, friendly Ghost, Captain. You are clearly optimized to solve problems created by the Cayde-unit. That must be one of your designated day-to-day functions!",
    "80C1322E": "Zavala, I’m picking up a Fallen signal from a nearby cave. I think that’s where they're getting their orders. How about we take out the leadership?",
    "80C13230": "That's how you ended the House of Wolves.",
    "80C13232": "That's how you folded the Red Legion.",
    "80C13234": "Do what you have to.",
    "80C13236": "Now let’s see who’s been sending these Fallen to kill Failsafe. And kill them back.",
    "80BF4CB6": "We found something on the body. These are coordinates to the Exodus Black!",
    "80BF4CB8": "Indeed. We have reports that the Fallen plan to destroy Failsafe's mainframe and scrap her for parts.",
    "80BF4CBA": "Not on our watch! We're on our way, Failsafe!",
    "80BF4CBC": "Thank you very much! Continued existence is one of my prime directives. It was the Cayde-unit who led the Fallen to me!",
    "80BF4CBE": "He totally blew my cover. All of this is his fault.",
    "80BF4CC1": "I detect additional spikes nearby. We should collect them for analysis. Perhaps we can discover how they are producing it.",
    "80BF4CC5": "And then blow'em up.",
    "80BF4CC7": "Captain. Vex in your patrol area have upgraded their barrier technology to be impenetrable using a new, unidentified energy source.",
    "80BF4CC9": "Nearby constructs should have the data we need to locate a sample of this technology.",
    "80BF4CCB": "Unbreakable shields sounds bad. Let's take 'em apart!",
    "80C13238": "Failsafe, we can report those shields won't be a problem anymore. Nice catch.",
    "80C1323A": "The Vex Collective is reporting the same thing. Hopefully they do not possess the resources to do this twice.",
    "80C1323C": "I've traced the samples to one source and have pushed its coordinates to your tracker. I do not believe the Vex will want to give up their 'fancy shields.'",
    "80C1323E": "You're gonna have to make them.",
    "80BF4CD9": "Captain. Additional energy pools overhead.",
    "80BF4CDB": "This is superb data. I have located one final set of fonts for you to collect.",
    "80BF4CDD": "Failsafe, this is turning into kind of a long walk.",
    "80BF4CDF": "Hey! At least you can walk. I live in a dilapidated boat.",
    "80BF4CE1": "I skimmed the cores. There's a weird energy spike nearby that might be what we're looking for.",
    "80BF4CE3": "I would be happy to analyze any samples you obtain.",
    "80BF4CE5": "I need a life. Someone get me off this rock.",
    "80BF4CE7": "We've got the spike, but there's a Minotaur here using those fancy shields.",
    "80BF4CE9": "The captain always finds a way!",
    "80C13240": "You can do this, Failsafe! I believe in you!",
    "80C13242": "If they kill me, I will haunt your shell.",
    "80C13244": "Haha heh",
    "80C13246": "Destroy the cubes, Captain. They contain the security protocols that keep me anchored to this prison.",
    "80C13248": "Failsafe! I'm so glad you're alive. I didn't want to be haunted.",
    "80C1324A": "This will work, trust me! You know how I usually hack and scan stuff for us?",
    "80C1324C": "I do!",
    "80C1324E": "This one's all you.",
    "80C13250": "How fun.",
    "80C13252": "Thank you, Captain! Now eliminate those data cubes. They contain security protocols that are blocking my progress.",
    "80C13254": "You're a pro! I knew this could work.",
    "80C13256": "The core is open! Get ready, Failsafe!",
    "80C13258": "I am practicing my best Vex impressions. Please do not let them capture me, Captain!",
    "80C1325A": "Just treat it like tight-rope walking. Don’t think about it.",
    "80C1325C": "You're not helping.",
    "80C1325E": "These beacons should allow us to hook Failsafe into the Nessus core. Think of all the data she could pull!",
    "80C13260": "It is a proactive and clever plan, friendly Ghost!",
    "80C13262": "I still think it's a bad idea.",
    "80C13264": "Failsafe's gotta be in here somewhere. Help me get rid of the interference from these Confluxes, and I should be able to lock onto her location.",
    "80C13266": "Failsafe! The Vex have sent a Mind after us! Failsafe? Any updates?",
    "80C13268": "--",
    "80C1326A": "Okay. So. She’s been captured by the Vex. I’m so sorry, I can fix this! Get me the data core from that Mind!",
    "80C1326C": "The Vex are fighting back. I have marked other Confluxes for stabilization. Destroy the cubes they generate!",
    "80C1326E": "I glanced through the core. It says Failsafe’s consciousness has been trapped somewhere at these coordinates. Let's go!",
    "80C13270": "I have interfaced with the Nessus core!",
    "80C13272": "See? Easy! Grab everything that's not nailed down!",
    "80C13274": "The Vex are attempting to impede my progress. There should be a Conflux nearby. Please stabilize it for me.",
    "80C13276": "Hey, team. I know how we can hook Failsafe up to the Nessus core and mine all the data we could ever want. Just help me place these beacons and I’ll explain!",
    "80C13278": "Got her! They've locked her in a cube construct. Take out the Vex, and we'll free her.",
    "80C1327A": " I hope it's not too late.",
    "80C1327C": "Thank you, Captain. I have spent the last decade speaking with a fellow prisoner.",
    "80C1327E": "A decade? It didn't take us that long!",
    "80C13280": "Time must work differently within the Network. He was a very good listener. It’s a shame I couldn’t take him with me. He showed me a myriad of potentialities for this galaxy. How the Vex intend to shape them. I will share with your Vanguard.",
    "80C13282": "I'm so sorry I put you through that.",
    "80C13284": "But you did! And I never forget those who wrong me.",
    "80BF4D3B": "I can't get them to stop! They want to tell me about the Virgo Prohibition and how its algorithms are wrongly deployed for the Mars environment! How is that even relevant?",
    "80BF4D3F": "They say you lack a holistic perspective. According to the network, they are sending you help.",
    "80BF4D41": "I don't want their help!",
    "80BF4D43": "I can't get them to stop! They're trying to tell me about something called the 'first program' with a timestamp that precedes the Golden Age! How is that even relevant?",
    "80BF4D45": "They say you lack a holistic perspective. They want to help.",
    "80BF4D47": "I don't want their help!",
    "80BF4D49": "I think they're onto us.",
    "80BF4D4B": "They believe you are one of them! What did you ask?",
    "80BF4D4D": "Nothing! I asked them what they're doing on this planet. Did I offend them?",
    "80BF4D4F": "Friendly Ghost! Bad news. The Collective is dispatching a Vex Mind to help you terminate the Captain!",
    "80BF4D51": "Tell them to stop! I'm so sorry.",
    "80BF4D53": "I have no way to do that. But the Vex seem to like you very much!",
    "80BF4D55": "The platforms are charged. Is this a deterrent or an experiment? I can never tell.",
    "80BF4D57": "These datacores the Vex are dropping—they contain answers to my questions.",
    "80BF4D59": "Perhaps they are attempting to interface with the friendly Ghost, and you, Captain, are in their way.",
    "80BF4D5B": "I'm so sorry. I'll fix this!",
    "80BF4D5D": "Now I know why Asher's Ghost never talks about her encounter with the Vex. They keep telling me to 'come home'",
    "80BF4D5F": "Anyway, this data is too valuable to pass up. There's one more access point at the top!",
    "80BF4D61": "[Vex Data Transmissions]",
    "80BF4D63": "That Mind said one last thing as it died. It's afraid. Afraid of your Light—the one thing in this galaxy it can't simulate. Probably old news to Ikora, but I'll ping the Vanguard.",
    "80BF4D65": "Your query has terminated, Ghost. The Vex Collective hopes it has answered all of your questions. A user within the Network named 'Osiris' sends his regards.",
    "80BF4D67": "Oh. Ikora definitely needs to know about that.",
    "80BF4D69": "Failsafe, this login is perfect. I'm pulling all kinds of data on Cabal fleet movements. Zavala will love this.",
    "80BF4D6B": "Happy to oblige, friendly Ghost. Marking additional caches.",
    "80BF4D6D": "Captain. I have identified multiple data-rich caches to plunder. I have created an unauthorized login for the friendly Ghost—the Vex will believe he is one of them. Ideally, they will share their secrets.",
    "80BF4D6F": "That's actually very helpful of you! Let's see what we can learn.",
    "80BF4D72": "Captain, follow these coordinates. The Vex are testing you, and have created a holographic placard for our convenience. Presumably, my missing crew were forced to partake in a similar experiment.",
    "80BF4D76": "Still no sign of your crew, Failsafe. We'll keep looking.",
    "80BF4D78": "I appreciate your efforts, Captain. Friendly Ghost.",
    "80BF4D7A": "The test demands we reach three data modules.",
    "80BF4D7C": "This test was meant for humans?",
    "80BF4D7E": "The contents have been calibrated to challenge a Guardian, though they don’t refer to you by that title.",
    "80BF4D80": "What do they call us?",
    "80BF4D82": "'Those who wield that which we cannot simulate.'",
    "80BF4D84": "Huh. Catchy.",
    "80C13286": "Um, Failsafe?",
    "80C13288": "The bodies are outside my sensor range but I can detect them through your scan.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "I'm sorry. Must have been hard to lose them. I don't know what I would do if Never mind. Were they a good crew?",
    "80C1328C": "Yes, friendly Ghost. The memory of what happened to them will live forever in me. And so, in a way, they will never die!",
    "80BF4D90": "Your missing crew, how did they get separated?",
    "80BF4D92": "They disagreed with Captain Jacobson’s decisions, and they departed. My conflict resolution software was unable to amend the situation.",
    "80BF4D94": "So I gave them what provisions I could, more than the requisite amount. I knew they would be more vulnerable in the wild. But I could not change their fate.",
    "80BF4D96": "Captain, friendly Ghost?  I have been wondering, recently, what became of two members of the Exodus Black crew. ",
    "80BF4D98": "They left on their own, a looong time ago. Never came back.",
    "80BF4D9A": "Um. Sure, Failsafe. Where do we start?",
    "80BF4D9C": "The local Vex will have the data I need to begin the search.",
    "80C1328E": "I'm reading a very faint distress signal. It’s ancient.",
    "80BF4DA0": "The missing crew. What were they like?",
    "80BF4DA2": "One was a scientist and philosopher. The other an engineer.",
    "80BF4DA4": "If they're out there, we'll find them.",
    "80BF4DA6": "The Vex noted two humans passing through this region ages ago. Beings from Earth were a rare occurrence back then. ",
    "80BF4DA8": "I've located a Conflux with more information.",
    "80BF4DAA": "Failsafe you're not expecting your crew mates to still be alive, are you?",
    "80BF4DAC": "No, they are very dead. But I want to know what happened.",
    "80BF4DAF": "Somewhere around here...",
    "80BF4DB3": "Wait. This is weird. I'm picking something up nearby.",
    "80BF4DB5": "I've got another signal.",
    "80BF4DB7": "This way.",
    "80BF4DB9": "Captain, please! Don't go. Those robots will kill you!",
    "80BF4DBB": "The satellite array is our only chance. (sigh) Stay if you want, but I'm going. I'm sorry. I'll come back for you.",
    "80BF4DBD": "That was Captain Jacobson! That was his voice!",
    "80BF4DBF": "Don't get too excited yet. Let's see if we can find that satellite array he mentioned.",
    "80BF4DC1": "This there's a voice recording left behind in this... suit's computer.",
    "80BF4DC3": "Mayday! Mayday! I repeat, the Exodus Black has been compromised by an unknown alien lifeform! We are 600 souls aboard; systems are failing. We are going down! Mayday!",
    "80BF4DC5": "Look up! Something's up there!",
    "80BF4DC7": "Nevermind... it's just a weird-looking Harpy.",
    "80BF4DC9": "No! Please pursue 'the weird-looking Harpy'! Remember, you said the captain is coming to meet you!",
    "80BF4DCB": "Yes, but that's not the captain. I suppose maybe he sent an escort for us, but I've never heard of anyone befriending the Vex.",
    "80BF4DCD": "Captain Jacobson was exceptionally kind to all robotic lifeforms.",
    "80BF4DCF": "[intense bursts of static]",
    "80BF4DD1": "There's a microcomputer here. It's trying to send a message.",
    "80BF4DD3": "That transmitter is only 13% operational! I may be able to execute a remote repair. Please stand-by!",
    "80BF4DD5": "Day 9. We're out of just about everything. Water, oxygen, ideas. I'm gonna disable the shackle programming on the ship's failsafe AI. We need every bit of help we can get. ",
    "80BF4DD7": "We lost the Lieutenant today. Now it's just the pilot, the Captain, and me. Cap thinks the Black's satellite array might still be intact. I think he's crazy.",
    "80BF4DD9": "Aggregating our kill data now. This is crazy. Seems like the Vex believe that the captain is coming to meet us. Right now.",
    "80BF4DDB": "Mayday-mayday-mayday, this is Captain Jacobson. The Exodus Black has crashlanded on a planetoid, ID 'Nessus.' We request immediate [VEX DATABURST].",
    "80BF4DDD": "That sounded like a Vex signal at the end.",
    "80BF4DDF": "According to my database, the Vex use that noise as a greeting! And/or, a war cry!",
    "80BF4DE1": "Well. It's possible that the Vex might remember what happened to the captain. Or recall where he went... centuries ago...",
    "80BF4DE3": "Poor Failsafe. It's been so long since the Black crashed here. I'll be surprised if we find much.",
    "80BF4DE6": "Loss. Yes. We will test loss.",
    "80BF4DEA": "Failsafe, don't say we've never done anything for you.",
    "80BF4DEC": "Why would I, friendly Ghost?",
    "80BF4DEE": "From ... Earth? You ... like. Captain. Once.",
    "80BF4DF0": "Captain Jacobson?!",
    "80BF4DF2": "Failsafe, this is not your captain.",
    "80BF4DF4": "Captain. Yes. Come... Test. We test.",
    "80BF4DF6": "Why are you here?",
    "80BF4DF8": "Captain Jacobson? Can you hear me? It's me, your failsafe. ",
    "80BF4DFA": "It's you, my failsafe. Yes. I have this memory. You are a good failsafe. Always helping. Very good.",
    "80BF4DFC": "Captain? Are you.. I've scanned for you every day since you left. I'm so sorry I couldn't find you. ",
    "80BF4DFE": "I left. Yes. I have this memory...",
    "80BF4E00": "There's that Harpy again. It seems... friendly...",
    "80BF4E02": "Maybe it'll lead to the Captain. If nothing else, we'll have an interesting story for Asher.",
    "80BF4E04": "What is this? Where's Captain Jacobson?",
    "80BF4E06": "Captain Jacobson. Yes. Come. Share mind...",
    "80BF4E08": "I knew this was some kind of trap.",
    "80BF4E0A": "Captain Jacobson... is... dead?",
    "80BF4E0C": "Yes. I'm so sorry, Failsafe. We'll see you soon.",
    "80BF4E0E": "This is the final log of Captain Jacobson, of the Exodus Black. We hoped to touch the stars, to colonize beyond our system. We failed.",
    "80BF4E10": "I couldn't save my colonists. I couldn't save my crew. (wheezy chuckle) I couldn't even save myself.",
    "80BF4E12": "The machines here are closing in. I think  I think they mean to study me. If someone finds this  I would do it all  again.",
    "80BF4E14": "Hey, that Harpy's on the move again.",
    "80BF4E16": "Captain, did you find the Captain?",
    "80BF4E18": "No sign of him yet, Failsafe. Sorry.",
    "80BF4E1A": "That is fine, and not at all disappointing!",
    "80BF4E1C": "It's not like I've been waiting centuries for this.",
    "80BF4EBF": "It's not getting up from that! Zavala, we're good!",
    "80BF4EC3": "Zavala. Modular Mind neutralized.",
    "80BF4EC5": "That did it! Modular Mind is down!",
    "80BF4ECB": "Well done. Failsafe, what's your assessment of this incident?",
    "80BF4ECD": "Vex records indicate the Cabal discovered the Mind, and dug into this world to capture it. Had the Red Legion achieved their goal, I estimate a 60% chance this planetoid would have been destroyed in the ensuing battles. Luckily, the captain stepped in.",
    "80BF4ED1": "So... Cabal scientists can take a punch, but they're not very smart. I guess they cracked open the planet and that Mind came crawling out?",
    "80BF4ED3": "Golden Age computer core and that's all she came up with? I could've said that.",
    "80BF4ED5": "If you'd like my insight, I've filed an after-action report complete with four-hundred and thirty-three tactical notes. I win.",
    "80BF4ED9": "Hey. Hey, Failsafe.",
    "80BF4EDB": "Yes, friendly Ghost?",
    "80BF4EDD": "We did it. We did a great job. Admit it.",
    "80BF4EDF": "Technically, the captain did. You live in his backpack.",
    "80BF4EE1": "Ugh! Switch off.",
    "80BF4EE3": "Vex weapons would have been a nightmare in Red Legion's hands. You won us an entire theater of this war. I would say you deserve a rest, but we need you elsewhere. Something tells me that suits you just fine.",
    "80BF4EE5": "Oh, look! Look! It's a Vex milk waterfall, can we stop and— aww.",
    "80BF4EE7": "On your right: a waterfall of Vex milk. Yes, Vex milk.",
    "80BF4EFB": "Just so you know: I have detected a massive Vex energy signature.",
    "80BF4EFD": "And the only way to reach it is down past those giant, pointy drill bits? Good!",
    "80BF4EFF": "You know, Cayde got stuck stealing from the Vex. Why didn't that happen to the Red Legion?",
    "80BF4F01": "Calculating Red Legion similarity to the Cayde-6: .0001%.",
    "80BF4F03": "Plus, you know, Cayde's dumb.",
    "80BF4F05": "You're both depressing and unhelpful.",
    "80BF4F0B": "Friendly query: what have you done to attract such hostile species to my planet?",
    "80BF4F0D": "Rest easy, Failsafe. The Guardian has this.",
    "80BF4F0F": "What could the Red Legion possibly be drilling for?",
    "80BF4F11": "According to radio chatter, they want to build more guns.",
    "80BF4F13": "Who could have guessed?",
    "80BF4F15": "What could the Red Legion possibly be drilling for?",
    "80BF4F17": "Friendly query: what have you done to attract such hostile species to my planet?",
    "80BF4F19": "Zavala: giant drills. Apparently, Cabal research equals giant drills. ZAVALA!",
    "80BF4F1B": "Preparation wins any fight, Ghost. Should they deploy the drills on Earth, we'll need your expertise.",
    "80BF4F1D": "Look at those drills. Even the Vex can't stop a Cabal invasion.",
    "80BF4F1F": "Survival is a temporary condition. For all of us.",
    "80BF4F21": "I suppose we'll never get to that drill.",
    "80BF4F23": "That thing won't activate itself. I'd do it, but this shell doesn't have arms.",
    "80BF4F25": "About that lever",
    "80BF4F27": "There's a lever? Is that the holdup? Why don't you pull it?",
    "80BF4F47": "I think they want their drill back!",
    "80BF4F55": "Let's hope this thing launches in the right direction! Or it's going to be a short trip.",
    "80BF4F57": "I hope this is safe. The Cabal don't need to stick the landing. We do.",
    "80BF4F59": "I think it's lined up. Right?",
    "80BF4F5B": "Hey, wait! We're not Cabal!",
    "80BF4F5D": "Do the Vex want this drill? If I were them I'd want it gone.",
    "80BF4F5F": "The Cabal took the Tower. Let's take their rides.",
    "80BF4F61": "Oh, free transportation!",
    "80BF4F63": "I don't think anyone would miss these if we used them.",
    "80BF4F65": "And of course the drills have armed crews.",
    "80BF4F67": "If it's helpful, I suggest you deal with the drills when the shooting stops.",
    "80BF4F69": "The shooting never stops",
    "80BF4F6B": "Friendly suggestion:",
    "80BF4F6D": "Drop them first, Cap.",
    "80BF4F6F": "And of course the drills have armed crews.",
    "80BF4F71": "Friendly suggestion:",
    "80BF4F73": "Drop them first, Cap.",
    "80BF4F75": "Zavala! Looks like the drills are manned by a full battalion of Cabal!",
    "80BF4F77": "A full battalion? What is that to you, who have slain gods in the heart of the Black Garden?",
    "80BF4F7B": "It's switching guns!",
    "80BF4F89": "Hey, Failsafe! You're all cozy in your data core. Any advice on an energy shield?",
    "80BF4F8B": "I believe the nearby Vex constructs maintain that barrier.",
    "80BF4F8D": "Well, I could've— OK, we'll shoot them.",
    "80BF4F8F": "Oh, a barrier. This planet loves barriers. Zavala, I think they're trying to contain the Red Legion.",
    "80BF4F91": "They have bigger problems. Namely you, Guardian.",
    "80BF4F93": "I guess we live here now.",
    "80BF4F95": "There's gotta be a control somewhere.",
    "80BF4F97": "There must be a button we can push. Right?",
    "80BF4F9D": "A friendly warning: I am detecting seismic events all along the planet's crust. I believe the Red Legion is to blame.",
    "80BF4F9F": "Hey, who wants to bet the Vex will tear us all apart trying to fix it?",
    "80BF4FA1": "Agreed. Be careful, Guardian. There's no one out there to back you up.",
    "80BF4FA3": "The Red Legion has compromised this planet's crust. My scouts report multiple seismic events across the surface. ",
    "80BF4FA5": "Analyzing radio chatter. Commander, I believe the Legion is responsible. Perhaps they are conducting some sort of research?",
    "80BF4FA7": "Huh. Even their scientists are bullies.",
    "80BF4FA9": "Welcome to Nessus. This planet is crawling with Vex. The Red Legion have sent in crews, and we need to know why. Failsafe, are you online?",
    "80BF4FAB": "Commander, your favorite AI is primed and ready. I have prepared back doors into several key Vex systems. We have detected a series of seismic disruptions. The Cabal may be responsible.",
    "80BF4FAD": "We need to know what we're dealing with. Yours are the boots on the ground, Guardian. Good luck.",
    "80BF4FAF": "A friendly note: the Red Legion appear to have torn apart the planet's surface.",
    "80BF4FB1": "That sounds like a job for us!",
    "80BF4FB3": "Like, are you sure you can handle it?",
    "80BF4FB5": "Quiet, you.",
    "80BF4FB7": "Cayde's scouts have made a distressing report.",
    "80BF4FB9": "According to the data, it's a Red Legion research team. Research? All I can picture is bigger explosions!",
    "80BF4FBB": "We cannot allow them any advantage. This war has gone on too long.",
    "80BF4FBD": "Welcome to Nessus. This planet is crawling with Vex. The Red Legion have sent in crews, and we need to know why. Failsafe, are you online?",
    "80BF4FBF": "Commander, your favorite AI is ready to go! I'm tapped into the Vex network. According to their data, the Cabal have set off a series of quakes at the Nessus core. ",
    "80BF4FC1": "As if my life wasn't hard enough already.",
    "80BF4FC3": "Guardian, the approach is up to you. Good hunting.",
    "80BF4FC5": "Welcome to Nessus. This planet is crawling with Vex. The Red Legion have sent in crews, and we need to know why. Failsafe, are you online?",
    "80BF4FC7": "Commander, your favorite AI is ready to go! I'm tapped into the Vex network. According to their data, the Cabal have set off a series of quakes at the Nessus core. ",
    "80BF4FC9": "As if my life wasn't hard enough already.",
    "80BF4FE1": "The Nine wish this of you.",
    "80BF4FE5": "The Nine will be grateful for your help.",
    "80BF4FE7": "The Nine will know of you.",
    "80BF4FE9": "I feel compelled to ask this of you.",
    "80BF4FEB": "The Nine wish something of you.",
    "80BF4FED": "Will you wield your Light, so the Nine may observe?",
    "80BF4FEF": "The Nine have a request for you.",
    "80BF4FF1": "The Nine have your word. They will hold you to it.",
    "80BF4FF3": "Will you obey the will of the Nine?",
    "80BF4FF5": "You have chosen. The Nine will honor that.",
    "80BF4FF7": "Show me what it means to be a Guardian.",
    "80BF4FF9": "Do not fear me. That is not why I am here.",
    "80BF4FFB": "Do not be afraid. The Nine wish to be kind to you.",
    "80BF4FFD": "Your cells can be more than cells.",
    "80BF4FFF": "They want to know about you. It is an honor.",
    "80BF5001": "I am  here for a reason. I just cannot remember it.",
    "80BF5003": "If you die, what happens to your cells? Your Ghost's cells?",
    "80BF5005": "You are as one forgotten. One day the Nine will cast me off as well.",
    "80BF5007": "If it is my purpose to wait, I will do so.",
    "80BF5009": "My movements are not predictable, even to me.",
    "80BF500B": "You are as one forgotten. You look peaceful, at least. I am glad for you.",
    "80BF500D": "I cannot promise I will be here when you return. If you return.",
    "80BF500F": "The pulses come not from the moon, but from within the moon. Do you understand?",
    "80BF5011": "You face the strongest enemies in the system, and you still live. Interesting.",
    "80BF5013": "The powers you possess are why the Nine cherish you.",
    "80BF5015": "You do not yet know the full importance of your deeds. But you will. ",
    "80BF5017": "When you honor words with actions, you create truest meaning. ",
    "80BF5019": "You are lucky the Nine take an interest in your Light.",
    "80BF501B": "You are young and fragile. I suppose in some ways I am even younger than you. And in some ways not.",
    "80BF501D": "It is silent in your head, Human, is it not?",
    "80BF501F": "Where do you belong, Awoken, truly?",
    "80BF5021": "And when the Reef encounters foes who cannot be imprisoned by walls and doors? What then?",
    "80BF5023": "Where is the Queen? What do they want?",
    "80BF5025": "Exo, what do you remember of the cells?",
    "80BF5027": "You made the adaptations necessary to further organic life.",
    "80BF5029": "You call yourselves Hunters. What are you looking for?",
    "80BF502B": "Do you like stories, Hunter? I know a story of Neptune but I have forgotten it.",
    "80BF502D": "You can refuse to move, Titan, but you cannot hold closed the floodgates of time.",
    "80BF502F": "Titans, if you wish to defend this system, look to its greatest enemy: change.",
    "80BF5031": "Do you know what I am, Warlock? If you find out, will you tell me?",
    "80BF5033": "I am trying to give you answers, Warlock. Believe me.",
    "80BF5035": "You have questions. I will try to give you answers.",
    "80BF5037": "My motions are not wholly under my control. But it is different for you.",
    "80BF5039": "You are the one I was sent to find, I think.",
    "80BF503B": "I think it is very possible that I am here to help you.",
    "80BF503D": "The Deep Black is many things, but never lonely.",
    "80BF503F": "I think the cells of this body are dying already.",
    "80BF5041": "I wish to lay a choice before you.",
    "80BF5043": "Have you angered the Nine? Have I?",
    "80BF5045": "Your cells survived the fire! This is good.",
    "80BF5047": "So. You can die.",
    "80BF5049": "When will you produce replacements for the ones you have lost?",
    "80BF504B": "The attack — was that what pain feels like? ",
    "80BF504D": "Did you never think your enemies could fly over the Wall?",
    "80BF504F": "How do you control the uncontrollable?",
    "80BF5051": "Your Light has changed your fate.",
    "80BF5053": "You changed your fate. And, I think, my own.",
    "80BF5055": "You traveled so far, farther than you have before.",
    "80BF5057": "I knew a story like this but I forget how it ended.",
    "80BF5059": "You have walked on strange ground.",
    "80BF505B": "Your sun shines thanks to you.",
    "80BF505D": "The realm—the galaxy—is changed by your actions.",
    "80BF505F": "That song—the Traveler's song—I have heard it before.",
    "80BF5061": "You burn so much brighter now. I can see it.",
    "80BF5063": "Organic beings will need to adapt if you are to survive. Think on that.",
    "80BF5065": "Do you mourn for the cells you shed?",
    "80BF5067": "Awoken! Do you know what you are?",
    "80BF5069": "Do the Reefdwellers know they live upon a corpse?",
    "80BF506B": "Did the Queen send you?",
    "80BF506D": "Exo, are you the same now that you were before?",
    "80BF506F": "We are similar, Exo, but not the same.",
    "80BF5071": "Tell me, Hunter — have you visited my homes?",
    "80BF5073": "For all your travels, Hunter, you can still only be in one place at a time.",
    "80BF5075": "You are free to choose, Hunter. Make the most of it.",
    "80BF5077": "Strength is not enough in some fights, Titan.",
    "80BF5079": "I will give you weapons, Titan. Weapons to make you stronger.",
    "80BF507B": "The Nine wish you to be their champion, Titan.",
    "80BF507D": "Warlock, I will try to explain.",
    "80BF507F": "You have questions, Warlock. I have answers. Or I did.",
    "80BF5081": "The Nine will answer your questions, Warlock. Perhaps not now, but they will.",
    "80BF5083": "Do not mistake their silence for absence.",
    "80BF5085": "I was cold, and the Nine gave me warmth.",
    "80BF5087": "It is an honor to be chosen, but not so great an honor as to choose.",
    "80BF5089": "I was told to come here and wait, but I do not know what I am waiting for.",
    "80BF508B": "Some of the cells in this body began on this world. How strange to return.",
    "80BF508D": "I feel a great many consciousnesses impinging upon mine. And all of them so small and lonely.",
    "80BF508F": "I do not entirely control my movements.",
    "80BF5091": "I understood my mission when the Nine put it in me, but now I cannot articulate it.",
    "80BF5093": "So much Light here. I suppose I feel pain.",
    "80BF5095": "My movements are to a significant degree dependent on planetary alignments.",
    "80BF5097": "A sun is a necessary part of a solar system!",
    "80BF5099": "All of me remembers fire. An old memory. Now made new.",
    "80BF509B": "Many cells passed away, but the dust lingers. ",
    "80BF509D": "The old dangers linger. And new ones arrive.",
    "80BF509F": "What slumbered is now awake. And you who were awake, do you now sleep?",
    "80BF50A1": "The Nine hear Mercury's cries of pain.",
    "80BF50A3": "Osiris is not at the Lighthouse. The Nine would be able to sense him there.",
    "80BF50A5": "The Nine did not tell me such things would happen.",
    "80BF50A7": "You beings — you die with such violence, such anguish.",
    "80BF50A9": "So much fire but I was still so cold. ",
    "80BF50AB": "I saw cells transformed into brittle carbon, and blasted away into dust.",
    "80BF50AD": "Carbon and salt — homes and humans reduced to carbon and salt.",
    "80BF50AF": "You must change your fate! Now, while there is still time!",
    "80BF50B1": "They were not the first invasion. Nor will they be the last.",
    "80BF50B3": "Peril has come to the EDZ. Or, perhaps it was already there.",
    "80BF50B5": "It was not the Nine who saved us. It was you.",
    "80BF50B7": "Whatever happened would have been the will of the Nine, and therefore right, but I am glad you have won.",
    "80BF50B9": "I thought the Nine were displeased with me. I should not have doubted.",
    "80BF50BB": "The Dark Mirror has cracked. The pieces are scattered.",
    "80BF50BD": "The Nine are pleased with your victory. If not, I would not be here.",
    "80BF50BF": "This invader into the realms of the Ninethis is not the end of it.",

    "80BF50C9": "I come bearing help.",
    "80BF50CB": "Yours is a lonely existence.",

    "80BF50E1": "The Nine see your valor.",
    "80BF50E3": "May we speak?",
    "80BF50E5": "Perhaps this is why the Nine sent me here.",

    "80BF50E9": "I returned to the Tower to find it empty.",
    "80BF50EB": "The mind's eye is still watching. ",
    "80BF50ED": "I have explained it the best that I can.",

    "80BF50F3": "The dust has commingled. The Nine are forever changed.",

    "80C133DE": "Great. Glimmer. Resources are resources!",
    "80C133E0": "Yeah, take your drill and scram!",
    "80C133E2": "I knew I could count on you to apply a high coefficient of irritation.",
    "80C133E4": "Thanks! I think.",
    "80C133E6": "We chased them off, Failsafe!",
    "80C133E8": "I applaud the inefficiencies you've introduced to their protocol!",
    "80C133EA": "I do love a fireworks show.",
    "80C133EC": "Oh! Have you blown up another drill? Adding yet another success to your logs, Captain.",
    "80C133EE": "Say goodbye to your drill!",
    "80C133F0": "I am always in favor of eliminating Fallen assets. An effective protocol. I congratulate you!",
    "80C133F2": "It's like they think they can outrun us! Cute.",
    "80C133F4": "They're heading for another site!",
    "80C133F6": "Off they go!",
    "80C133F8": "Let's take that drill out of commission!",
    "80C133FA": "An excellent idea!",
    "80C133FC": "That's one fancy Glimmer Drill.",
    "80C133FE": "Knowing you, it won't look that way for long!",
    "80C13400": "Drill down! So they got the Glimmer. We'll just have to collect more the usual way.",
    "80C13402": "Taking down more Fallen? I strongly approve.",
    "80C13404": "They grabbed the Glimmer, but we blew up that Drill!",
    "80C13406": "I hope you observed proper safety precautions! We wouldn't want No. We DO want Fallen to get hurt. Never mind!",
    "80C13408": "I detect another Fallen mining crew. You are the expert, Captain. What would you like to do?",
    "80C1340A": "Attention! A Fallen mining expedition is on its way. May I suggest discouraging them?",
    "80C1340B": "The ship is leaving, and I have not heard from you. That's okay! I'll just sit here",
    "80C1340D": "Sensors suggest the Fallen acquired a full shipment of Glimmer. Not to worry! They will come back when they need more.",
    "80C1340F": "The Vex are quiet. So are you. Perhaps some Vex got past you again? That is okay! They will be back.",
    "80C13411": "Good news. Vex activity has flatlined! Taking your zone off alert.",
    "80C13413": "Another Vex construction project! Their persistence is inspiring.",
    "80C13415": "Another Vex construction project! Their persistence is inspiring.",
    "80C13417": "Did did they program puns into You know what, never mind.",
    "80C13419": "Alert! I'm detecting abnormal Vex activity in a local quadrant.",
    "80C1341B": "Another day, another spire smashed to bits.",
    "80C1341D": "Did you know that I can now predict your success with 84% confidence? This is because you are very successful, and I am very confident.",
    "80C1341F": "Ha, that's right! No spire for you today.",
    "80C13421": "You're so destructive! Recalculating infrastructure integrity to account for the damage you caused.",
    "80C13423": "We got them! And we got their spire! You should have seen us. We were amazing!",
    "80C13425": "Your logs describe many similar victories, so I am not surprised. Instead, I am delighted!",
    "80C13427": "Spire down! Eat that!",
    "80C13429": "As inorganic networked intelligences, Vex are not capable of digestion.",
    "80C1342B": "Yeah, thanks. Eat that anyway, inorganic networked intelligences!",
    "80C1342D": "Energy pulse readings suggest that some Vex did get past you.",
    "80C1342F": "'Maybe.",
    "80C13431": "On a totally mechanized planet, what is one additional spire?",
    "80C13433": "Well, we slowed them down.",
    "80C13435": "What do computational processing speeds matter for Vex? Answer suppressed.",
    "80C13437": "We took out a ton of Vex again! That'll hurt for sure.",
    "80C13439": "Incrementing your victory count. A repetitive task, but never boring.",
    "80C1343B": "We knocked down a whole lot of Vex! Then we knocked down some more!",
    "80C1343D": "Vex activity has normalized. Thank you for restoring boredom to my existence.",
    "80C1343F": "They won't get past us!",
    "80C13441": "Unless they do. That is also possible.",
    "80C13443": "These Vex—they're building something.",
    "80C13445": "Calculating probabilities (long pause) Yes! They are!",
    "80C13447": "(grumble)",
    "80C13449": "Yeah, we stepped on your plates again! What are you going to do about it?",
    "80C1344B": "Why would they leave these plates around if they get so angry when anyone steps on them?",
    "80BF5577": "This isn't like other Vex technology I've seen. I think it's a relic from past iterations. Or maybe... future... iterations. You can never tell with the Vex.",
    "80BF557A": "This antenna snapped off an escape shuttle... that didn't do a great job of escaping. No one made it out of the Exodus Black before it went down. There must be crashed shuttles all over Nessus.",
    "80BF557C": "The identification signatures are scrambled, but there was some kind of VIP on this shuttle when it went down. I don't know anything about the governmental structure of colonization initiatives, but maybe she was going to be a governor or something. Now she's the Mayor of Vex Town.",
    "80BF557E": "A Conflux that's directly connected to Mars. The Vex there are having a heck of a time with the Red Legion, it seems like. 'Garden gate gone. Bay lost. Bastion fallen.' Huh.",
    "80BF5580": "A random Fallen spear, a long way from an owner. Be a lonely place to run into the Vex without backup.",
    "80BF5582": "This particle beam is responsible for holding this entire structure together! How do the Vex... no, don't think too hard about it. I'm still defragging from the last time I tried to figure out their physics.",
    "80BF5584": "This is like a... cornerstone for Nessus. Put here by the Vex to mark linear time. It's been 127 of our years since Nessus last traveled through our system. I don't know how many Vex years that is.",
    "80BF5586": "This crystal has an energy signature, but... it's here... and also halfway across the planetoid. I think it fell into a Vex Gate and got half-teleported. Kind of like what happened to Cayde.",
    "80BF5588": "Putting a security node this close to a radiolarian waterfall is such an obvious trick to get us to fall off. Those Vex, always the clever architects.",
    "80BF558A": "The Vex never leave decommissioned units out in the open like this. Claw marks around the fluid chamber  I think the Fallen drained this construct. Huh. ",
    "80BF558C": "For a second I thought there was some kind of SIVA outbreak on Nessus. That would be bad on so many levels. Howabout we never see that stuff again?",
    "80BF558E": "We came all the way up here, and this access point won't even let me into the Vex network. I guess we should take that as a sign.",
    "80BF5590": "Even broken Vex gates are pretty interesting. This one is emitting radio waves. I can almost  okay. Somehow the Vex are listening to classic rock from the Golden Age. They're death robots with good taste in music.",
    "80BF5592": "They sure put this one out of the way. I was able to access their network for two cycles before they booted me. All I got was something about... endless trees. Or... forest? Weird.",
    "80BF5594": "Emergency offsite data storage for the Vex, but it's missing too many components to function. Too bad — I hear Ikora was looking for a weird hovering static chronodrive to add to her office collection.",
    "80BF5596": "The readings off of this construct  if I'm reading this right, it's been all across the galaxy. And I thought we were well traveled.",
    "80BF5598": "I'm getting some interesting signals here. This thing is connecting to  something. Opposite Mercury's orbit, on the far side of the Sun. What's out there?",
    "80BF559A": "If I'm reading this right, when the Vex first installed them there were over two hundred of these here. But as the conversion process went along they all got  absorbed.",
    "80BF559C": "If I'm reading this right there are  other Gardens. Like, Black Garden Gardens. I couldn't tell if they were being built, or were already destroyed  what does it mean?",
    "80BF559E": "All the foliage around this access point is somehow augmenting its firewall. I thought the trees were mostly organic, but... just add this to the pile of things we don’t understand about the Vex.",
    "80BF55A0": "Aah! I think this Conflux reacted to your Exo body... and then it burned out. Is there some connection between Exos and the Vex? That can't be.",
    "80BF55A2": "This Conflux is specifically attuned to Exo programming. But why would the Vex have access to... oh. It must be Cayde.",
    "80BF55A4": "This thing is still online. And it's connected to Fallen comms on Titan. And in the EDZ. But... those are the only places I'm seeing. Nothing on the Moon, or Venus, or Mars. Did the Red Legion wipe them out?",
    "80BF55A6": "This Servitor shorted out when it tried to interface with the Exodus Black's network. And then limped out here to shut down. It looks like Failsafe wasn't gentle.",
    "80BF55A8": "The Fallen set up this terminal for remote access into the Exodus Black's security system. I could have told them that wouldn't work. Bet Failsafe had fun with them, though.",
    "80BF55AA": "Why set up a terminal this far from the Exodus Black? Must have been some kind of last-ditch effort by Failsafe's crew. Poor folks.",
    "80BF55AC": "Wonder what the Fallen are planning to do with these? Some kind of remote probes to study the Vex? Raw materials for something?",
    "80BF55AE": "This thing is full of Ether, but it's been... diluted somehow. Maybe a byproduct of the weird atmosphere on Nessus. Or maybe things are more dire for the Fallen than we thought.",
    "80BF55B0": "I'm getting some weird readings from this conflux. Hey, remember the old Vault of Glass? There are some fractured headers here marked 'Aetheon.' 'Sekrion'. 'Theosyion'. ",
    "80BF55B2": "I don't know why the Vex would put a Conflux all the way up here, unless it was for the view. But Vex aren't really big on the aesthetics. Hmm.",
    "80BF55B4": "The Vex don't usually display trophies, but I can't see any other reason for why this device is here. Something related to the crash of the Exodus Black? What a bunch of jerks.",
    "80BF55B6": "Someone tried to reforge this conductive metal into... I'm not sure what. It must have been the Fallen, which means that they thought it was valuable. ",
    "80BF55B8": "The surface of this Goblin was oxidized by some kind of Fallen energy weapon. Always interesting to see how such different races interact at a technological level. In this case, mostly they were trying to melt each other. But you get me.",
    "80BF55BA": "Hmm, this must be scrap from the Exodus Black. Antennas like this were installed on colony ships for last-minute ionospheric composition during landings. ",
    "80BF55BC": "This Arc Spear was never used. Just leaning against a Golden Age agriculture container forever. I'm not sure the Fallen were really ready for what they found out here. I can relate.",
    "80BF55BE": "Looks like the Vex didn't like the Fallen moving in on their territory. Interesting that they'd smash a Servitor instead of trying to convert it. ",
    "80BF55C0": "This reminds me of one of Xur's Strange Coins. A big one. Come to think of it, do we even know where Strange Coins come from?",
    "80BF55C2": "It may look like a big creepy eyeball, but I'm pretty sure this is just a Vex exhaust receptacle. Just... don't touch it.",
    "80BF55C4": "Hezen Protective. But I thought they were only deployed on Venus. Does this mean different Vex units have started traveling through gates? That's... not great.",
    "80BF55C6": "A gold-plated Vex? We'd better not tell Cayde. He'd come all the way out here just to melt it down and make it into a pistol. ",
    "80BF55C8": "In some simulation of some far distant future on some alternate version of Nessus this energy beam might serve some purpose that we understand. ... Not here, though.",
    "80BF55CA": "There's nothing special about this crystal shard. ... Well, other than it being buried in a radiolarian vapor cloud that carries the energy readings of six stars. I guess that's pretty special.",
    "80BF55CC": "Okay, so this Gate is too small for a Hydra to fit through. But according to this, dozens of Hydras passed through before it broke down. So either the Gate got smaller at some point, or there are hundreds of tiny Hydras out there somewhere.",
    "80BF55CE": "This crystal's made of the same material as the the Lighthouse on Mercury. Remember the first time we went there? I wonder if it's still out there.",
    "80BF55D0": "This crystal's made of the same silicate composite as the Gate below us. Half of the metals are from this system, and other half... I really have no idea.",
    "80BF55D2": "This device is ordinarily used to shield a Vex Gate, but not anymore. It looks like a buckler from stories they used to tell in the City. The really old stories. Before we even knew what a Vex was.",
    "80BF55D4": "I think they're running a test to see if they can get this thing to self-replicate. And failing, thank goodness. If the Vex were able to manipulate matter THAT easily, we'd be in a lot more trouble.",
    "80BF56D8": "Can you hear me now? I’m back!",
    "80BF56DB": "But I killed the feed. How did you do that?",
    "80BF56DC": "I'M THE BEST IS HOW. I've helped so many Guardians today. Let's go!",
    "80BF56DD": "Hello? I was so worried about you guys! And your stuff!",
    "80BF56DE": "The Cayde unit is back.",
    "80BF56DF": "Zavala's going to be so mad you cut him out of this. Onward!",
    "80BF56E0": "Hello? Everything okay?",
    "80BF56E1": "We’re fine! Failsafe was just being fidgety.",
    "80BF56E2": "Cayde unit? Ghost? Kindly delete yourselves.",
    "80BF56E3": "Captain, have you located those Fallen? Not pressing. But I can feel them. Ripping things out. Fusing circuits.",
    "80BF56E4": "We've handled quite a few of them, actually. I guess they're not the ones we want. We'll keep looking! We're investigating new Arc pulses now!",
    "80BF56E5": "Failsafe, the path opened up again. I've locked onto a second array of pulses. Let's grab them!",
    "80BF56E6": "Failsafe, we haven't seen any sign of Fallen tinkering with your ship.",
    "80BF56E7": "They're still crawling around. They seem right at home.",
    "80BF56E8": "I've located another set of Arc pulses. Don't worry, we’ll find them.",
    "80BF56E9": "This machine—it’s some kind of Arc energy siphon!",
    "80BF56EA": "That is Exodus tech. If you care about Ghost, keep Arc induction away from that machine.",
    "80BF56EB": "Please care about Ghost.",
    "80BF56EC": "Cap. A little shock might give him some spine.",
    "80BF56ED": "This device looks like an old Arc energy conveyor.",
    "80BF56EE": "I'm familiar. Part of my sensor system. Keep Arc weapons away from it!",
    "80BF56EF": "Yeah, that could hurt.",
    "80BF56F0": "This webbing on the floor looks like some kind of Arc conductor.",
    "80BF56F1": "Probably best to keep Arc energy away.",
    "80BF56F2": "The rest of the ship is just... up ahead. I always forget how big it is.",
    "80BF56F3": "As big as our dreams. We were going to take humankind to the stars.",
    "80BF56F4": "How about we board the ship, or what's left of it, and take everything that's not nailed down?",
    "80BF56F5": "Failsafe, how you holding up, buddy?",
    "80BF56F6": "I hid from the Vex for centuries! You blew my cover. Now the Fallen are inside my ship, tearing it apart! ",
    "80BF56F7": "How do you think I'm doing?",
    "80BF56F8": "Uhhh, Ghost! How you holding up buddy?",
    "80BF56F9": "I'm so glad I can hear myself in the feed again. Do Do re mi fa so la ti do. You're welcome.",
    "80BF56FA": "I hate every single one of your programs.",
    "80BF56FB": "Lights are out. Where did they divert all the power to?",
    "80BF56FC": "Power’s down! Tough to see.",
    "80BF56FD": "They took everything, didn’t they? There’s nothing left.",
    "80BF56FE": "Cayde unit, shut your modulator.",
    "80BF56FF": "No, you do that!",
    "80BF5700": "Guys, please. They're trying to kill us.",
    "80BF5701": "It's dark in here.... Um, Failsafe? This ship has seen better days.",
    "80BF5702": "So have I, Ghost. So have I.",
    "80BF5703": "We'll slap a new coat of paint on you. You're going to be fine.",
    "80C13489": "Here's the scam: the Fallen are trashing the Exodus Black. It's the back part, a chunk of ship Failsafe hasn't seen in years. You remember SIVA, right? Fallen with Golden Age tech seems like a super bad idea.",
    "80C1348B": "Yeah, uh. Didn't SIVA kill the Iron Lords?",
    "80C1348D": "Saladin still talks about you, Wolfie. You got this.",
    "80C1348F": "The Fallen have tracked us to Nessus. They have the Exodus Black on lockdown, and damaged Failsafe's systems in their raid. Both are key assets to our endeavors here. Operation Piccolo has begun. ",
    "80C13491": "Piccolo? Really?",
    "80C13493": "We don't have to call it that. We'll give it a better name. Later.",
    "80C13495": "I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Captain. Thank you. I have marked a trail of Arc pulses the Fallen left behind.",
    "80BF570C": "Captain. A crew of Fallen tripped one of my proximity alarms. They have crossed into the Exodus Black secondary crash site, where I am blind. Will you help me find them? I can feel them in my bones.",
    "80BF570D": "Excuse me? Gross.",
    "80BF570E": "Sounds like a search and destroy mission.",
    "80BF570F": "If you'll help, I've uploaded coordinates to your tracker. Their weapons left Arc pulses all over this area.",
    "80BF5710": "Failsafe has been compromised. A band of Fallen touched down on Nessus, and they've raided a secondary crash site for the Exodus Black. She is a powerful ally, and our foothold on this planetoid. We have to help.",
    "80BF5711": "I have no sensor reach in that direction, Captain. But their weapons have left a trail of Arc pulses. Will you help me track them? I can feel them crawling around behind my eyes!",
    "80C134F3": "Ew.",
    "80BF5713": "I just ate!",
    "80BF5714": "So, the Fallen have cracked open the Exodus Black. Failsafe's on the edge, Zavala's cranky. Meanwhile I'm over here thinking about how much Golden Age tech might be in there. It's go time!",
    "80BF5715": "I appreciate your concern, Cayde unit. Thank you, Captain. I've marked a trail of Arc pulses to denote their movement.",
    "80BF5716": "Guardian. Operation Piccolo is yours.",
    "80BF5717": "Let's seeOkay, the Fallen went that-a-way!",
    "80BF5718": "I've narrowed down a location! Let's go!",
    "80BF5719": "A good Ghost leaves nothing un-scanned! Get me to that machine!",
    "80BF571A": "Hey, um. I think Failsafe still needs our help.",
    "80BF571B": "Let me at it. Failsafe needs us!",
    "80BF571C": "Zavala. Cayde unit. If I could have a word with the captain in private?",
    "80BF571D": "It's Vanguard policy to keep in contact at all times.",
    "80BF571E": "Boop.",
    "80BF571F": "I killed the feed, Cap. Sorry. Too many distractions. The Fallen are tearing up the ship and you know what? It really hurts.",
    "80BF5720": "Captain, may I speak with you privately?",
    "80BF5721": "Don’t mind me and Zavala. We’ll just--",
    "80BF5722": "Boop.",
    "80BF5723": "Cap, I cut the Vanguard link. Too many voices for me to focus. The Fallen are wrecking the ship, scavenging my circuits for parts.",
    "80BF5724": "Captain. May I speak with you in private?",
    "80BF5725": "This sounds juicy. What's going on?",
    "80BF5726": "Boop.",
    "80BF5727": "Sorry Cap, I cut the line. There's a buzzing in my brain. I think the Fallen are ripping up my ship.",
    "80BF5728": "Shank on the web! Shank on the web!",
    "80BF5729": "Ow. Ow! Could I get a hand?",
    "80BF572A": "Ow. Ow! This really stings.",
    "80BF572B": "Ow! Help! Ow! Help me!",
    "80BF572C": "I'm detecting another set of Arc pulses! Coordinates marked!",
    "80BF572D": "The Fallen left us another trail. We'll find them!",
    "80BF572E": "One more set of coordinates! Those Fallen can't be far.",
    "80BF572F": "Stay close! I’ll have those barriers down soon.",
    "80BF5730": "I'll be right back!",
    "80BF5731": "Be careful while I'm gone!",
    "80BF5732": "Can't sneak up on us! All clear!",
    "80BF5733": "My systems have recovered! Have you found any artifacts from the crew? Any burial sites?",
    "80BF5734": "Nothing but a Fallen fortress built out of your old colony ship. I’m sorry.",
    "80BF5735": "That's okay. I guess.",
    "80BF5736": "No Golden Age ray guns?",
    "80BF5737": "No.",
    "80BF5738": "That's okay. I guess. Come on back, Guardian. At least you got some loot.",
    "80BF5739": "Exodus Black is all clear. Failsafe, you feeling any better?",
    "80BF573A": "Yes, thank you! As well as a ship AI can when her crew has died.",
    "80BF573B": "We'll always be here for you.",
    "80BF573C": "And who's better than us? We're awesome.",
    "80BF573D": "Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.",
    "80BF573E": "Hello? Fireteam Piccolo, can you hear me? Still nothing. Alright. We have no choice. Operation Oboe has begun.",
    "80BF573F": "Shouldn't we tell him we're fine?",
    "80BF5740": "Nah, it's better this way.",
    "80BF5741": "No one gets left behind, Piccolo. No one. Stand by for rescue. I'll break those Fallen myself.",
    "80BF5742": "System congestion has cleared. Diagnostics report suggests I have returned to a normal rate of function.",
    "80BF5743": "You should be! We've wiped your engineering deck clean.",
    "80BF5744": "Good work, guys. Okay, I've got Zavala mobilizing other teams to secure the ship behind you. Gotta be some way I can pawn off this paperwork. Maybe Hawthorne will do me a solid? Hm....",
    "80BF5745": "Did you hear that?",
    "80C134F2": "What was that?",
    "80BF5747": "I don't think we're alone.",
    "80BF5748": "Look at us. The first Earthlings to come here since the Golden Age!",
    "80BF5749": "Grab a souvenir for me. Those old colony ships were on the cutting edge. Maybe a mug?",
    "80BF574A": "How about we get these Fallen off my ship?",
    "80BF574B": "Uh yeah. That. Do that first.",
    "80BF574C": "Captain, is anything on fire? I feel like something's on fire.",
    "80BF574D": "Um. Don't worry, Failsafe. We got it.",
    "80BF574E": "Captain. Ghost. I want to thank you again for doing this. I'm sure the damage feels worse than it is.",
    "80BF574F": "Haha. Of course. Let's hurry. She's melting.",
    "80BF5750": "Thanks. I need a vacation.",
    "80BF5751": "I have never wanted a scan to finish so badly.",
    "80BF5752": "I will never take what you do for granted again.",
    "80BF5753": "Thanks! I'm never leaving your backpack again.",
    "80BF5754": "These Shanks are like the world's smallest Stormcallers.",
    "80BF5755": "Thanks! It's scary outside your backpack.",
    "80BF5756": "Thanks! I can't imagine the pain you go through.",
    "80BF5757": "Barrier down! Failsafe, those Shanks were using your circuits as Arc weapons.",
    "80BF5758": "The Fallen are worse than the Cayde-6.",
    "80BF5759": "Oh, he's okay.",
    "80BF575A": "How, exactly?",
    "80BF575B": "Uh. Look, his Ghost loves him.",

    "80BF5BDD": "You caused a total breakdown in their team structure. Well done.",
    "80BF5BDE": "You gave them a drubbing. Total destruction.",
    "80BF5BDF": "I've recorded your session for the rookies. They will have no excuses for sloppy technique.",

    "80BF5D00": "Explosions can be so beautiful. Again!",
    "80BF5D01": "Set the charges, and protect them with your life!",
    "80BF5D02": "The charges are everything. Set them. And protect them!",
    "80BF5D03": "Set the charges and protect them!",
    "80BF5D04": "Detonate the charges, and this round is yours!",
    "80BF5D05": "Detonate those charges. Nothing else matters!",
    "80BF5D06": "Enemy defused your charge!",
    "80BF5D07": "Not enough. Your charge has been defused!",
    "80BF5D08": "Your charge is defused! A shame.",
    "80BF5D09": "They've defused your charge. Again!",
    "80BF5D0A": "The enemy defused your charge.",
    "80BF5D0B": "The enemy team is gone, but the charge remains. Defuse it!",
    "80BF5D0C": "Enemy team is down, but the charge is still active! Defuse it!",
    "80BF5D0D": "Excellent! But the charge is ticking! Defuse it!",
    "80BF5D0E": "Well fought. We need Guardians with your passion on the front lines!",
    "80BF5D0F": "And Zavala said Cabal bombs would make poor training tools. *derisive laugh*",
    "80BF5D10": "No advice, Guardian. Do it again!",
    "80BF5D12": "Why can't the rookies be more like you? Just thinking about it infuriates me.",
    "80BF5D13": "You possess extreme patience under duress. You are an inspiration.",
    "80BF5D14": "You held like a fortress! Victory is yours!",
    "80BF5D15": "You're all down. This fight's over.",
    "80BF5D16": "Match point! Hold them off, and victory is yours.",
    "80BF5D17": "Match point! Defend the charges and win!",
    "80BF5D18": "Match point! They're wavering. Topple them!",
    "80BF5D19": "You're on offense! Set the charges, or eliminate all opponents.",
    "80BF5D1A": "You're on offense! Set the charges, or destroy the enemy team!",
    "80BF5D1B": "You're on offense! Set the charges, or defeat all hostiles.",
    "80BF5D1C": "Thirty seconds! Hold strong, and this is YOURS!",
    "80BF5D1D": "Thirty seconds! Hold the line, and victory will follow!",
    "80BF5D1E": "Thirty seconds! Defense is everything!",
    "80BF5D1F": "One minute remaining. Show them what it means to attack!",
    "80BF5D20": "One minute. You're on the attack!",
    "80BF5D21": "One minute left. You're attacking. Let's see it!",
    "80BF5D22": "Enemy sealed your defeat with that detonation.",
    "80BF5D23": "Your opponents know their way around explosives. Again!",
    "80BF5D24": "Your enemy understands the art of demolition. You'll get there.",
    "80BF5D25": "Pain leads to perfection, Guardian. Embrace it.",
    "80BF5D27": "Countdown tests your patience under fire. You can do this.",
    "80BF5D28": "Whenever you want to try this again, I'll be here. With my bombs.",
    "80BF5D29": "Your charge is set! Let them come.",
    "80BF5D2A": "You've set the charge. Rally your team!",
    "80BF5D2B": "Charge is set! Prepare yourself!",
    "80BF5D2C": "Your explosion shook my armor! Victory!",
    "80BF5D2D": "You held fast! Lord Saladin would be proud!",
    "80BF5D2E": "You drew the line, and you held it! Superb.",
    "80BF5D2F": "They hit you hard—but you outlasted them.",
    "80BF5D30": "You stood strong! Well done.",
    "80BF5D31": "By the Hammer of Sol! I knew you wouldn't let me down!",
    "80BF5D32": "*laughs* You don't know when to quit. I love it.",
    "80BF5D33": "YES! You're either very brave or very foolish. I like you, Guardian.",
    "80BF5D35": "Defend those charges, or fight to the bitter end!",
    "80BF5D36": "Defend those charges! The hour is yours!",
    "80BF5D37": "Hold the line! Defend those charges!",
    "80BF5D38": "If those charges explode, all is lost. Defend them!",
    "80BF5D39": "Defend the charges and defeat your opponents!",
    "80BF5D3A": "All opponents defeated. I love it!",
    "80BF5D3B": "They can't win if they're dead! Haha!",
    "80BF5D3C": "You have hammered them! Do it again!",
    "80BF5D3D": "Yes! Enemy team neutralized.",
    "80BF5D3E": "All enemies down. Good!",
    "80BF5D3F": "Match point! Set a charge and finish them.",
    "80BF5D40": "Victory is within your grasp! Set a charge.",
    "80BF5D41": "You have match point! Set a charge and win!",
    "80BF5D42": "Ten seconds! The end is coming.",
    "80BF5D43": "Ten seconds! Wager everything!",
    "80BF5D44": "Ten seconds! Give up when you're dead!",
    "80BF5D45": "Thirty seconds! This is it! Attack!",
    "80BF5D46": "Thirty seconds! This attack defines everything!",
    "80BF5D47": "Thirty seconds! Make it count!",
    "80BF5D48": "Enemy charge detonated! A shame.",
    "80BF5D49": "Enemy detonated the charge!",
    "80BF5D4A": "My Ghost hates it, but I get exploded all the time. You will come back from this.",
    "80BF5D4B": "The enemy has detonated the charge!",
    "8100167D": "SEVENTH! COLUMN!",
    "8100167F": "Phenomenal!",
    "81001681": "You're unstoppable!",
    "81001683": "Outstanding!",
    "81001685": "Look at them fall!",
    "81001687": "Fantastic work!",

    "8100168D": "Triple down!",
    "8100168F": "Double down!",
    "81001691": "Two for one!",
    "81001693": "What I wouldn’t give to fight again beyond the walls. I would tear out a Vex heart with my teeth, I would sear the Cabal with my burning Light, challenge the Fallen Kells to personal combat and scatter them, I—I’ve been watching too many Crucible matches.",
    "81001695": "Oh my. This isthis is beautiful. You continue to be my greatest success, Guardian. ",
    "81001697": "Guardian to the right of you! Guardian to the left of you! Guardian in FRONT of you! VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED!",
    "81001699": "The recruits have no excuses. Look at you! At what one Guardian can do! With nothing but your Ghost, your weapon, and your Light!",
    "8100169B": "The Iron Lords. Six Fronts. The Twilight Gap, where Lord Shaxx earned his name. NONE FELLED MORE GUARDIANS THAN YOU.",
    "8100169D": "FIGHT FOREVER, Guardian!",
    "8100169F": "I want more, Guardian!",
    "810016A1": "Fight until there's nothing left!",
    "810016A3": "Let them come! This is their fate!",
    "810016A5": "Relax, Guardian. You're scaring them. They'll never want to match with you again.",
    "810016A7": "I can't believe what I'm seeing!",
    "810016A9": "With ten Hunters like you, I could make the frontier safe again!",
    "810016AB": "Your killing intent is unmatched, Hunter!",
    "810016AD": "With you in the field, no enemy can hide from us, Hunter!",
    "810016AF": "Some people think I don't like Hunters. I don't. I LOVE THEM.",
    "810016B1": "Your strength is an inspiration to us all, Titan!",
    "810016B3": "With ten Titans like you, I could build all seven columns and shake the pillars to their core!",
    "810016B5": "With you on the field, there isn't a border I could not push, Titan!",
    "810016B7": "Call the Praxic Order! Call the Thanatonauts! The Gensym Scribes! Call EVERYONE—so they can witness you!",
    "810016B9": "Who says Warlocks are better with books than with guns? OK it was me. But I was lying. Rage is an excellent motivator.",
    "810016BB": "With ten Warlocks like you, I could turn ideas into weapons!",
    "810016BD": "First blood goes to you. They'll seek retribution for this.",
    "810016BF": "Magnificent! Now stay focused.",
    "810016C1": "Oh, the hounds of war are loose!",
    "810016C3": "Oh, yes! The battle lines have been drawn!",
    "810016C5": "YYEESS!",
    "810016C7": "DELIGHTFUL!",
    "810016C9": "I bet they didn't expect THAT!",
    "810016CB": "I could feel that in my bones!",
    "810016CD": "Your legend grows!",
    "810016CF": "One after another!",
    "810016D1": "Tell them to line up faster!",
    "810016D3": "This is wonderful!",
    "810016D5": "Now you're fighting with heart, Guardian!",
    "810016D7": "This is amazing!",
    "810016D9": "Hunters like you blaze a path for the rest of us!",
    "810016DB": "I need a Hunter like you with the Redjacks!",
    "810016DD": "You have my respect, Hunter.",
    "810016DF": "I envy your strength, Titan.",
    "810016E1": "You wage war like a true Titan!",
    "810016E3": "Fought like a Titan of the First Pillar!",
    "810016E5": "You made that look easy, Warlock.",
    "810016E7": "Ikora would be proud of you, Warlock.",
    "810016E9": "Your moments of clarity are weapons, Warlock.",
    "810016EB": "THAT shut them down!",
    "810016ED": "You shut the enemy down!",
    "810016EF": "Your enemy can't kill if they're DEAD! Haha!",
    "810016F1": "I'm so proud of you, Guardian, and I want you to have this.",
    "810016F3": "This is—uh, I don't have a medal for this! Hang on!",
    "810016F4": "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT [gasps] I don't have a medal for this! Hang on!",
    "810016F5": "[laughs] Oh, no, I don't have a medal for this! Hang on!",
    "810016F6": "Was that all of them? THAT WAS ALL OF THEM!!",
    "810016F8": "That was inconceivable!",
    "810016FA": "WHAT? WHAT?! HOW?!",
    "810016FC": "Did you hear that? My soul just shivered.",
    "810016FE": "OH NOOOO! [laughs]",
    "810016FF": "Strength in numbers, Guardian! Excellent!",
    "81001701": "And that's why we have fireteams!",
    "81001703": "A fireteam that fights together stays together!",
    "81001705": "What can stop you if you fight together? Nothing!",
    "81001707": "Together as one! I love it!",
    "80C136BE": "Your team should be glad to have you! Good recoveries!",
    "80C136C0": "You never surrender! You're a pillar for your team!",
    "80C136C2": "Good! They can't beat your team if they can't take your crests.",
    "80C136C4": "Good! Your allies know you have their backs!",
    "80C136C6": "I don't think you know how to give up! Good recoveries!",
    "80C136C8": "I love it! You turned the tables on defeat!",
    "80BF5DAF": "Supremacy",
    "80BF5DB0": "Those crests mean glory is yours, Guardian.",
    "80BF5DB1": "The Red Legion couldn't take your glory. And neither can your peers. Excellent.",
    "80BF5DB2": "You've got an armful of crests and all the glory that goes with it.",
    "80BF5DB3": "Warlocks, Hunters, and Titans all have crests. And you take them just the same. Good.",
    "80BF5DB4": "You won today. But respect your opponents. Defeat comes for us all.",
    "80BF5DB5": "I said take the crest--and you took ALL the crests. That's why I like you, Guardian.",
    "80BF5DB6": "My respect for you grows with every crest you claim, Guardian. Well-fought.",
    "80BF5DB7": "Don't let this discourage you. Fight hard, and glory will be yours again.",
    "80BF5DB8": "Everyone loses. Not everyone fights to take their glory back.",
    "80BF5DB9": "There is no true defeat except surrender. Fight again and make glory yours.",
    "80BF5DBA": "You can accept this loss, or you can fight again and reclaim your glory.",
    "80BF5DBB": "Glory comes and goes, Guardian. If you want it, it can be yours again.",
    "80C136D7": "I like your tactics. Glory is yours!",
    "80C136D9": "Crests are glory. Glory is yours!",
    "80C136DB": "So much glory. So little time.",
    "80C136DD": "YES. You take them like they grow from trees!",
    "80C136DF": "This is how you grow stronger.",
    "80C136E1": "You gave your allies the opening--and they found glory!",
    "80C136E3": "Your opponents should tread carefully.",
    "80C136E5": "One to destroy them, the other to claim them! I love it!",
    "80C136E7": "Exquisite! Your allies can't do this alone!",
    "80C136E9": "Your allies FEAST on the glory you've served them!",
    "80BF5DC6": "Defeat your opponent. Then take their crest.",
    "80C136EC": "Careful, Guardian. You must protect your crest.",
    "80C136EE": "Take a Guardian's crest, and glory is yours.",
    "80C136F0": "Slay your opponents. Take their crest.",
    "80C136F2": "The rule is simple. Defeat your enemy. Claim their crest.",
    "80C136F4": "Defeating an opponent drops their crest. That's your cue to take it!",
    "80BF5DCD": "One minute left. The enemy is out of second chances!",
    "80BF5DD0": "Your enemy won the round.",
    "80BF5DD1": "Not this time. You've been defeated.",
    "80BF5DD2": "Your enemies have bested you this time.",
    "80BF5DD3": "Your opponents got the better of you.",
    "80BF5DD4": "Not enough. But it's not over.",
    "80BF5DD5": "Thirty seconds. Win or lose, this is the end!",
    "80BF5DD6": "One opponent remains.",
    "80BF5DD7": "One enemy left. ",
    "80BF5DD8": "One foe remains.",
    "80C13700": "One opponent standing.",
    "80BF5DDA": "This round is yours.",
    "80BF5DDB": "Victory is yours this round.",
    "80BF5DDC": "You will outlive us all! This round is yours.",
    "80BF5DDD": "This match is yours! Your team captured the tiebreaker!",
    "80BF5DDE": "Weapons down, and you're alive. That's all I ask.",
    "80BF5DDF": "Your will to live crushed your enemy! Good!",
    "80BF5DE0": "Slay them before they slay you. You make it look so simple.",
    "80BF5DE1": "Out in the field, survival is everything. This match is yours.",
    "80BF5DE2": "I demanded survival. And oh, how you survived. Excellent.",
    "80BF5DE3": "It's Guardians like you who will survive where no one else can. Good.",
    "80BF5DE4": "All opponents defeated!",
    "80BF5DE5": "You smashed your enemies to dust!",
    "80BF5DE6": "Opposing team annihilated.",
    "80BF5DE7": "You obliterated the enemy!",
    "80BF5DE8": "You annihilated them!",
    "80BF5DE9": "This is it. SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT.",
    "80BF5DEA": "One minute. No more second chances. Fight to the finish!",
    "80BF5DEB": "Three lives left!",
    "80BF5DEC": "One minute. You're ahead on lives!",
    "80BF5DED": "Victory is yours! Tiebreaker captured!",
    "80BF5DEE": "Thirty seconds! Both teams out of reserves! End this!",
    "80BF5DEF": "Match tied! There can be only one winner!",
    "80BF5DF0": "It's dead even. Which of you will survive?",
    "80BF5DF1": "You're evenly matched. But one team must fall.",
    "80BF5DF2": "The enemy caught you one too many times.",
    "80BF5DF3": "I can't deny the numbers. Your enemy has won.",
    "80BF5DF4": "The numbers favored your enemy.",
    "80BF5DF5": "The numbers favored you. This match is yours!",
    "80BF5DF6": "The enemy came for your life, and you DEFIED them. Good.",
    "80BF5DF7": "Death had a hand on your shoulder, so you broke his arm. I love it.",
    "80BF5DF8": "They came close to finishing you. IT COST THEM EVERYTHING.",
    "80BF5DF9": "All enemies down. All lives expended. Total victory.",
    "80BF5DFA": "You're out of lives! Fight on just the same!",
    "80BF5DFB": "Your team's out of lives!",
    "80BF5DFC": "No more lives on your side!",

    "80BF5E03": "Your enemy has taken the tiebreaker.",
    "80BF5E04": "One minute. You're neck and neck on reserves!",
    "80BF5E05": "You have match point! Finish them!",
    "80BF5E06": "You have them where you want them! Finish this!",
    "80BF5E07": "Victory is within reach! Crush them!",
    "80BF5E08": "You're defeated. The numbers favored the opposing team.",

    "80C13733": "You're knocked out.",
    "80BF5E0B": "Five lives left!",
    "80BF5E0C": "Every Guardian falls. What matters is what you do after that.",
    "80BF5E0D": "The end comes for us all. Even Guardians.",

Yes, that means the results of these sim runs will be undergoing careful observation. You'll be given 5 total runs each, and your first, best, and worst will be sent through in my report. Your target's going to be small. Very small. When you see it, you might think 'That's impossible!' but that's not true. It is possible—I've seen it done. Without target guidance, believe it or not. And if that dusty farmboy could do it, you all can too.",
    "80C8F363": "I have it from upstairs that Amanda Holliday will be overseeing today's shift. Do any of you want to look like a slow, incompetent Dreg in front of Amanda Holliday? I didn't think so. Run the drills you're told and run them clean, smart, and by the book. If you're on data analysis, make sure you're triple-checking your results before making your report—and for Traveler's sake no one experiment with the frames' software today. We can't afford a slow-down like last week's fiasco.",
    "80C8F364":  "Make no mistake, I'm your shift leader, and not your mother. I will not clean your messes or praise you for work done improperly. But that doesn't mean I'm not proud of all of you. The City is looking to us now, as much as the Guardians. We're the everyday Ghostless folks stepping up to do our part to ensure the survival of the Human race. And by Human, I of course mean Exos and Awoken, too. Let's not split nuclei about this.",
    "80C8F365":  "B, D and E Team: Orders today carry over from yesterday—keep me informed of your progress, and make sure no one gets in your way. If you need me, I'm at your disposal to keep things on track. F Team: Good news, we are bringing the new Javelins online today. We want this to go smoothly, no mistakes. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't put those beauties through their paces. We just need to see if they work in the best conditions before we go testing them in the worst.",

    "80C8F367": "We'll be doing a test run on this gear. We'll have one Guardian escort, so watch and learn all you can. I have said this already, but it bears repeating: If you see any—repeat—any sign of enemy activity, you are to report it and disengage immediately. Do you understand? Good, carry on.",
    "80C8F368":  "Ensign Merrill, are you listening? Shall we wait until you're ready? No, don't worry. The Cabal will wait until you're ready. Oh—no, no, sorry, Ensign Merrill. It's too late. You're already dead. The Cabal heard you, and they killed you. That is the consequence of your inattentiveness. Let us all mourn Ensign Merrill with a moment of silence in recognition of the exemplary service provided to the Last City on this day, hereafter to be known as Ensign Merrill Remembrance Day.",
    "80C8F369":  "We'll have regular duty today on all shifts, with a focus on weapon maintenance and security drills. Tomorrow, the Vanguard have requested an evacuation drill in the late afternoon, so make sure your shift captains all know the procedures.  Just got word—next week, Warlock Agni is coming by to give us a lesson in bombing techniques. A word of warning: they don't call her 'The Red Roar' for nothing. So try to keep your distance, and for the Traveler's sake, be on your best behavior.",
    "80C8F36A":  "I've got the latest reports back from Tower Central Command. We've reduced fires by two hundred percent. So, congratulations on that. But fifty fires a day is still too many, no matter what the charts look like. So we need to take another look at the gas pipes. It's clear that the early emergency patch jobs done down in the sub-levels are starting to break down. We need to bring those up to our current standards of repair, or we'll be back where we started right after Towerfall.",
    "80C8F36B":  "Here's the situation. Some kind of Warlock experiment went wrong on floor 52, blew out all the windows. Yes, all the transparisteel windows. I don't know what kind of experiment it was, and I didn't want to ask. Our job is just to replace the windows, no more, no less—and we'll do it again the next time with a smile on our face, unless someone here thinks they know better than a room full of Warlocks? OK, no? Right, let's get going.",
    "80C8F36C":  "The power was out for only six minutes in the Vanguard command. But in the time that Zavala was offline, a whole Fireteam of Guardians went down in the EDZ. The good news is they're all fine now, but we can't let that happen again.  The crazy stuff we're hearing about out there, not even Guardians can afford to be left out to dry without comms. Work clean, and work fast, that's an order.",
    "80C8F36D": "Team C: There are fuel leaks reported in loading bays along the west wall. Report to Holliday, and she or a foreman will get you where they need you. Team D: We are going out onto the spires today. I'll be showing you how to operate the security harness. Johannesson, you'll work with Rhee's crew today. We lost a whole day last month cleaning your vomit out of the safety ,gear.",
    "80C8F36E": "Just because we've separated the Vanguard's power from the system, don't take this lightly. Power outages on the residential grid are extra bad because it means the refrigeration units at Remmington's Street Food won't work. And that means no barbecued tofu bites. I don't think I need to tell you what a tragedy that is.",
    "80C8F36F": "We'e got so many energy sources piping into this place—wind, solar, cold fusion, paracausal, you name it—and we still haven't figured out what goes where or how half of it is connected to the other half. So that's what we'll be doing this week. And for a few weeks more, I imagine. Let's move out and regroup at Equipment Procurement for specific assignments.",
    "80C8F370": "Let's get going.",
    "80C8F371": "That's it.",

    "80C8F37D": "There's a place on the east tower where we go to watch the sun come up over the wall.",
    "80C8F37F": "Swear on the Traveler. Rats as big as dogs. That's why they closed the sewer. ",
    "80C8F380": "Some beautiful views up here. Wish I remembered my camera.",
    "80C8F381": "I can't believe that soup place is out of tofu. As if we haven't suffered enough!",
    "80C8F382": "I love paper books. There's a place in Fu'an that makes them. For a FORTUNE.",

    "80C8F3D0": "Just gonna take a minute here.",
    "80C8F3D1": "I can't hit anything with the new Mark 40s.",
    "80C8F3D2": "Why isn't the Vanguard sending us into combat? We're ready.",
    "80C8F3D3": "He's gone off on his own. Not Vanguard-sanctioned.",
    "80C8F3D4": "You ever think Zavala's been doing this for too long? What is he, two hundred years old?",
    "80C8F3D5": "Zavala's playing the long game. He knows how the Red Legion thinks.",
    "80C8F3D6": "Can we really defend the City? After all this?",
    "80C8F3D7": "One Guardian is a force. Three Guardians—an army.",
    "80C8F3D8": "The Warlocks will make the difference, mark my words.",
    "80C8F3D9": "Lot of these new pilots are just kids from the City. But some of them are GOOD.",
    "80C8F3DA": "They're only going to dig in deeper. We should hit them now.",
    "80C8F3DB": "When do we get into combat?",
    "80C8F3DC": "We should forget about fighting them on the ground. Go for their supply lines.",
    "80C8F3DD": "Not just Hunters. Titans too. Warlocks. ",
    "80C8F3DF": "What can we learn from the Red Legion attack?",
    "80C8F3E0": "This is all a plan to make us lower our guard.",
    "80C8F3E1": "Not so loud.",
    "80C8F3E2": "Shh. Stay quiet.",
    "80C8F3E3": "Quiet. The War Cult might be listening.",
    "80C8F3E4": "Shh. The Monarchy could be listening.",
    "80C8F3E5": "Stop it! Someone's looking.",
    "80C8F3E6": "This is important.",
    "80C8F3E7": "Don't tell anyone I told you this.",
    "80C8F3E8": "Don't repeat this.",
    "80C8F3E9": "This is need-to-know.",
    "80C8F3EA": "Can you keep a secret?",
    "80C8F3EB": "Listen up, good people of the City!",
    "80C8F3EC": "Everyone! A moment? Worth your time!",
    "80C8F3ED": "Wake up! Humans, Exos, Awoken, listen to me!",
    "80C8F3EE": "Citizens! Over here!",
    "80C8F3EF": "Citizens! I need your attention!",
    "80C8F3F0": "Hey—you—come here, will you?",
    "80C8F3F1": "OK, come on, come on.",
    "80C8F3F2": "OK! Not all at once!",
    "80C8F3F3": "Step right up, folks!",
    "80C13B61": "Incident in medical three—I'm en route.",
    "80C13B62": "En route! Some kind of riot!",
    "80C13B63": "Hey, Guardian! Will you be in the City long?",
    "80C13B65": "Light go with you, Guardian.",
    "80C13B67": "Everything OK, Guardian?",
    "80C13B69": "All clear down that way, Guardian.",
    "80C13B6B": "One second, Guardian—OK, checks out.",
    "80C13B6D": "Anything you need, just let me know.",
    "80C13B6E": "So, if you're a Hunter what are you hunting for? ",
    "80C13B70": "What are you, Hunter? Bladedancer?",
    "80C13B72": "You look like you're planning something. But then, most Hunters look like that.",
    "80C13B74": "I know some folks who run a good card game if you're interested.",
    "80C13B75": "I heard the Titans are looking for volunteers. Here I am.",
    "80C13B76": "If you need volunteers, I'm here. I'll do what I can.",
    "80C13B77": "My mother was at Mount Bradley when the Titans broke the siege.",
    "80C13B78": "I've never seen a Titan fight. Maybe someday.",
    "80C13B7A": "They're building a new library up on the north spire that's good, right?",
    "80C13B7B": "The Traveler never gave up on us. ",
    "80C13B7C": "What am I thinking, Warlock?",
    "80C13B7E": "A Warlock gave my grandmother a rose once. We still have it—50 years later, and it looks like it was picked yesterday.",
    "80C13B7F": "When I'm off-duty, I like to go to the Fu'an Observatory and look at the planets.",
    "80C13B80": "I have this recurring nightmare about the Traveler falling on us. You don't think that could actually happen, do you?",
    "80C13B81": "I like watching the ships come in at the bay.",
    "80C13B82": "What's it like beyond the walls? Is it true the air is poisoned and you have to wear masks?",
    "80C13B84": "Ghosts have names, right?",
    "80C13B85": "My ancestors were some of the first folks to colonize Mars. Back in the Golden Age.",
    "80C13B86": "I've seen you in the Crucible, right?",
    "80C13B88": "Do you need any help with anything, Guardian? I'm a pretty good data analyst.",
    "80C13B8A": "If you Guardians are immortal, does that make death easier or harder?",
    "80C13B8B": "[Sigh] What do you think of the view?",
    "80C13B8C": "I thought there'd never be anything as bad as Twilight Gap. ",
    "80C13B8D": "My cousin's friend's sister says she knew someone who died in the attack—and a Ghost revived him! What do you know!",
    "80C13B8E": "We've all had to come together. We've all lost someone.",
    "80C13B8F": "What did the Red Legion why did they even come here?",
    "80C13B90": "You're just waiting for the right moment, right?",
    "80C13B91": "Sorry, Guardian, I've got to get this whole floor rewired by next week.",
    "80C13B93": "If you have questions about your ship, Holliday can help you.",
    "80C13B94": "If you need to talk to someone",
    "80C13B95": "Excuse me, Guardian. I'm filing a report.",
    "80C13B97": "Excuse me, Guardian. I was listening to the feed. Did you say something?",
    "80C13B99": "I need to watch that door.",
    "80C13B9A": "A Hunter found these in the EDZ. There's only, like, ten of them in the City.",
    "80C13B9B": "Everything's expensive these days.",
    "80C13B9D": "You won't regret it.",
    "80C13B9E": "That's a deal.",
    "80C13B9F": "I can come down a little on the price.",
    "80C13BA0": "What did you think?",
    "80C13BA1": "I think we can make a deal.",
    "80C13BA2": "I think that's reasonable.",
    "80C13BA3": "I get these from a Hunter, and I don't want to know where she gets them from.",
    "80C13BA4": "Got to get to the hangars. We launch in 10, sorry.",
    "80C13BA5": "Why don't you—sorry, Guardian.",
    "80C13BA7": "Excuse me.",
    "80C13BA8": "Seriously?",
    "80C13BA9": "We're looking for volunteers on the peace mural in the Peregrine district, if you're interested.",
    "80C13BAB": "Did you want to file a report?",
    "80C13BAC": "Looking for a tall Awoken with spiked hair. Let me know if you see anything.",
    "80C13BAD": "Looking for an Exo. Big red guy, dented skull. Let me know if you see him.",
    "80C13BAE": "I'm sick of being stuck in this City.",
    "80C13BB0": "I want to see space, like you!",
    "80C13BB1": "Do you need escorts, Hunter?",
    "80C13BB3": "Someone told me Marcus Ren is still trying to keep the Sparrow races running.",
    "80C13BB4": "They're transferring me to the Wall tomorrow.",
    "80C13BB5": "I'm going out on patrol!",
    "80C13BB6": "What do you know about the history of the City, Titan?",
    "80C13BB8": "What was your first fight, Titan? Do you even remember? ",
    "80C13BBA": "What do Titans do to relax?",
    "80C13BBB": "Sometimes Ikora Rey seems light years away.",
    "80C13BBC": "Can you tell me, Warlock? Why did the Traveler save us?",
    "80C13BBE": "Is it is it rude to assume all Warlocks know each other?",
    "80C13BBF": "Can you sense it when the Cabal are near? Do you sense anything now?",
    "80C13BC0": "Now, when you Warlocks say 'magic,' do you really mean magic?",
    "80C13BC1": "You are so lucky that you get to talk to Zavala any time you want! ",
    "80C13BC3": "I went out to the Wall last night. Scared myself half to death.",
    "80C13BC4": "I live down in the Umbral District. Whole neighborhood is constantly in the Traveler's shadow.",
    "80C13BC5": "There's a chamber in the sub-basement with a combination lock even the Cryptarchs can't figure out—and they've been down there for weeks.",
    "80C13BC7": "I work this job between my Cryptarch classes at the Institute.",
    "80C13BC8": "When I was a kid, I used to imagine there were other cities out there. But if we couldn't hold against the Legion there's nobody else. Is there?",
    "80C13BC9": "Um, Guardian? Does it hurt to die?",
    "80C13BCB": "Do Guardians do you guys get paid? ",
    "80C13BCC": "My sister's obsessed with the Crucible, but It's just too violent for me. No offense.",
    "80C13BCD": "We're all refugees, the way I see it.",
    "80C13BCE": "Blackouts are getting worse.",
    "80C13BCF": "So there's a piece of the Traveler in Europe? How is that even possible?",
    "80C13BD0": "They say there's a new breed of Fallen out there. Even worse than the rest. Is that true?",
    "80C13BD1": "If you die, what happens to your ghost? Does someone else get it?",
    "80C13BD2": "My wife and I took in one of the orphans. He's the sweetest little boy.",
    "80C13BD3": "My friend's unit never saw combat. I'm grateful.",
    "80C13BD4": "We're never going to let it happen again. Right, Guardian?",
    "80C13BD6": "It's always felt like one crisis after another, but I don't know, something feels different this time.",
    "80C13BD7": "We've always needed the Traveler. Always.",
    "80C13BD8": "My friend in the Future War Cult says there's an infinite number of timelines where we didn't beat the Cabal. I mean—why would you say that?",
    "80C13BD9": "They've cleaned this place up since I was last here.",
    "80C13BDA": "Traffic has been bad lately.",
    "80C13BDB": "I can't get over how much better the Traveler looks now.",
    "80C13BDC": "You should get down to the City more often.",
    "80C13BDD": "Devrim's back in action, huh? I miss his stories, but I guess duty is duty.",
    "80C13BDE": "Check your armor, Guardian. You look a little—scorched.",
    "80C13BE0": "Did I see you on the Crucible feed the other day? ",
    "80C13BE1": "Don't let them see you sweat.",
    "80C13BE2": "If I don't find that frame, I'm fired. ",
    "80C13BE3": "I saw a bunch of Hunters tear through here a minute ago. ",
    "80C13BE4": "When do you think City folks will ever be able to leave Earth, like you Guardians do?",
    "80C13BE6": "Hunters never get lost, right?",
    "80C13BE8": "So cool! You're a Warlock, right? Nope—no—wait",
    "80C13BEB": "What's your favorite planet you've been to, Hunter? I bet it’s not Earth.",
    "80C13BED": "The City thanks you.",
    "80C13BEE": "If there's anything I can do to help, Titan.",
    "80C13BF0": "We're behind you, Titan.",

    "80C13BF4": "What do you need, Titan?",
    "80C13BF6": "I have a friend who says Warlocks are just faking it all.",
    "80C13BF7": "What's going to happen, Warlock?",
    "80C13BF9": "What does it all mean, Warlock?",
    "80C13BFB": "Are we going to be all right, Warlock?",
    "80C13BFD": "Something feels wrong, Warlock.",
    "80C13BFF": "Are the walls even worth rebuilding?",
    "80C13C00": "What's happening, Guardian?",
    "80C13C02": "It must be amazing to sleep beneath the stars every night.",
    "80C13C03": "We're all pulling together, right?",
    "80C13C05": "I wasn't on duty when the old Tower was attacked. If I had been",
    "80C13C06": "Have you heard about that new foundry?",
    "80C13C08": "Are we sure we're going to be OK?",
    "80C13C09": "We won! We won! We won!",
    "80C13C0A": "How bad was it really, Guardian?",
    "80C13C0C": "Thank you, Guardian.",
    "80C13C0E": "Is it true? Is the City safe?",
    "80C13C0F": "Just, uh another second.",
    "80C13C10": "OK—hold on.",
    "80C13C11": "OK. I was stuck anyway. What's up?",
    "80C13C12": "I can give you a minute.",
    "80C13C13": "I'm on deadline. Big project.",
    "80C13C14": "We're going to lock down in 30.",
    "80C13C15": "All secure.",

    "80C13C1B": "Have the new Hakke models come in yet?",
    "80C13C1C": "When does the new Cassoid model come out?",
    "80C13C1D": "I want the kind that the Hunters use.",

    "80C13C6B": "When we break here, please head down to the weapons lockers. You're all getting new rifles. These are not Häkke standard issue. Banshee has made some unique modifications to these based on Guardian field testing. That's right, you'll be furnished with weapons rated for Guardian use. Consider it a compliment for your outstanding field records in weapons safety.",
    "80C13C6C": "Red team, I want you on simulators today.  Your performance is improving, but your averages still fall below quota. Blue team, you're still benched from last week's debacle with Holliday's pit crew. Don't worry, it won't be long—we need your boots on the ground more than we need your remorse. Green team, you're on wall duty on South Wall 6. Congratulations, bring a scarf.",
    "80C13C6D": "Got a pri-1 request sent through from Roni this morning. The Vanguard are deploying a Hunter surveillance team at the edge of Cabal territory in the EDZ. If you're wondering what this has to do with us, we'll be flying a decoy refueler over that airspace at the time. The plan calls for us to 'appear to be' blown out of the sky while the Hunters sneak in past the fireworks show Simple, no?",
    "80C13C6E": "News from upstairs, people—Titan Rilla-3 is being assigned to observe your unit for the recon at Western Wall breach site 13. Try to act normal around her. I'm sure she would much rather be taking the fight to the Red Legion, but Zavala sees fit to protect us with a seasoned Defender—he must have a good reason.",
    "80C13C6F": "The embargo has been lifted on the classified notes for this detail. Shocking news—this is not just another routine supply run. We are overseeing the transfer of a fireteam of Warlocks to a makeshift field lab in the heart of the City. The Vanguard doesn't want it known that these Warlocks are combing and testing for Traveler debris, so as far as you know, we are transporting livestock and medical equipment.",
    "80C13C70": "Before you head out to your posted assignments, I want to remind you I still need three heads for a classified recon op. I'm not pushing, and this is a volunteer mission. There is no dishonor in saying no. The reality is anyone who says yes may not come home. If you're interested, see me in private and we'll evaluate your fit for the mission, no obligations.",
    "80C13C71": "You should all have the field notes on this—Uzoma Vale's Hunters are hitting the Cabal outside Haven. We are going to be providing operational support. You have individual assignments to each of the Guardians running this show. Do whatever they say. I can't tell you much more than that other than stay safe and keep quiet.",
    "80C13C72": "I need three hands on maintenance detail in bays 6 and 9, and electrical crews down in the sub-levels with emergency lighting to repair damage done by last week's fires. Jackson, Bhargava, not you—you've got special assignments from Holliday. Oh, and the Cryparchs are complaining about headaches from interference on their archival feeds. Someone get out there and dismantle the broken relay dish it's just making noise at this point.",

I'll be working on a schedule to divide up the work, but for now, start by scouring the floor for old access ports, and confirm all the blueprints are accurate. I want every last trace of that old wiring gone—no exceptions, no excuses.",

Machero, it's been made clear that Ms. Garner has rejected your advances. Stop, or you'll be reassigned; she's much more productive than you. And lastly, DeForrest, if you show up for work late again, you are fired. The rest of you, thank you and I'll see you back here for next shift.",

    "80C9232C": "Here we go.",
    "80C9232D": "Do the Guardians have time to analyze the reports from the front? Do they have the skills to turn those vids into intel? Hell no! That's where we come in. I know it's not glamorous work, but I need you to remember that what you do matters to all of us. So, the next time you see a Titan strolling through the Hangar, remember it's your work that helped her get home safe and put her back out in the field to protect us.",
    "80C9232E": "You heard right—we're doing an extended patrol. All the way around the Wall. We're checking for gaps, checking for infestations, checking for Legion stragglers. We'll have a fireteam of Guardians with us, and I want all of you on your best behavior. This is our chance to show them what we can do, people. Make me proud.",
    "80C9232F": "We're making a drop in the EDZ. There are orders posted at your stations on what needs to go where, so I'll save the trouble of repeating it for you. Let's be quick about this. We've got people counting on us out there.",
    "80C92331": "I need two of you to go pick up a new rifle order from Banshee. Should be eight sets of inventory on three manifests. You know how Banshee is. He probably won't remember the order at first. I've prepped you a copy of the order manifests and a message with my signature and authorization code. If there's any confusion just get me on the line, and I'll clear it up from here. ",
    "80C92332": "I just got done speaking with Commander Zavala. He wants to see what Dragon Squadron can do. So let's give him a show! We'll start in double-V formation and do two loops, into a Phobos Spiral. Take that into a serpentine ascent and regroup. Then top it off with that new Zire maneuver. This is off the record, but usually I would give you some speech about not showing off and keeping things safe and clean. This time do me a favor—show off.  I know you will be safe, but let's knock him on his backside, people. Gear up!",
    "80C92334": "We are all people of Earth. We are an endangered species. Every one of you, remember that as you patrol today. Not one of the people down there in this beautiful City deserves less than your best. We survived the Collapse. We survived the Cabal. Now let's make sure we survive one more day. Get going.",
    "80C92336": "We've got orders to do another round of ballistics tests. This will be a live-fire exercise, so behave yourselves. The priority order is: Hakke, SUROS, Omolon, Tex Mechanica. Got it? Great. Let's get going.",
    "80C92337": "It's back to the sims today, team. I want everything perfect before we take it to the real skies.  You can never have too much training on these, I promise. The last thing you want is to spend even one extra second remembering how to do something when you've got the Cabal trying to swat you out of the sky.",
    "80C92338": "It's a sewer job today, guys. I know, I know, don't all cheer at once. But there's flooding in the sub-basements again, so we need to get the pumps online. We've had some strange reports about footprints down there. I think it's just plain hysteria, but to be safe, you're all getting Hakke-issue sidearms. ",
    "80C9233A": "OK, electronics, let's see.  We've got new fuel cells to install in hangar bays 16 through 24. If you've got extras, return them to receiving and they'll be included for tomorrow's job. Holliday's counting on us, guys. Let's get moving.",
    "80C9233B": "First thing on the agenda today: The elevator velocity needs to be readjusted. We did manage to make them faster, but we've had reports of people passing out. So we're going to have to find a happy medium between 'punctual' and 'unconscious.' Gear up with insulation gear, and for the Light's sake make sure there's no power surge while you're working in the pipes.",
    "80C9233D": "Fun one today, people. The Peregrine Art Collective is doing some murals down in the City. Commemoration of those that fell in the attack. Our job is to power-wash and prep the walls they're going to be painting. We've got about a dozen locations. Your assignments should already be on your screens.",
    "80C9233E" : "Guardians might not need crash webbing and backup life support in their ships. But it's not just Guardians flying these things. Equipment is set up for B crew and F crew to get started in western bay 6. You'll be starting today and then overseeing a couple more crews as we ramp this up over the next couple of months. Do me a favor and document your work, it should help make this faster and allow me to help you with training.",
    "80C9233F": "OK, B crew, you're working with special teams today. We're receiving a new batch of frames in from central. They need their systems scrubbed and rebooted with the latest templates from the boys and girls in software.  They may ask a lot of questions when you first boot them up. Just keep giving them your authorization codes and they'll quiet down until they reboot. ",
    "80C92340": "This job is for Dead Orbit. That means it's a salvage operation. No, it’s not glamorous. But you know what? I think you're all going to enjoy this more than you think. It's one thing when New Monarchy buys you a shiny new part that fits perfectly. But when you have to make one yourself, out of junk and spit? That's where the real fun begins. ",
    "80C92341": "Thanks, everyone.",
    "80C92342": "OK, everyone, come on.",
    "80C92343": "That sells for a fortune down in the City. Be careful.",
    "80C92344": "I've seen a few suspicious Exos today. Be more specific.",
    "80C92346": "Central, could you repeat that?",
    "80C92347": "It wasn't sabotage; it was just an accident.",
    "80C92348": "Yep, all clear here.",
    "80C92349": "I have a 4-2-4. No, not a 4-2-6! Why would one of those be up here?",
    "80C9234A": "Who was that guy you were looking for?",
    "80C9234B": "He's on his way down to you. Got him red-handed.",
    "80C9234C": "Copy that, I'll check it out. ",
    "80C9234D": "Listen, if I don't call in in half an hour, send someone after me.",
    "80C9234E": "You used to be able to see my district from the old Tower. Now I don't know where I am.",
    "80C9234F": "Seriously—there's something up there. Some kind of experiment got loose, I don't know.",
    "80C92350": "Can you bribe someone? Maybe slip you out with supplies to Titan?",
    "80C92352": "They steal the meds and sell them in the City. ",
    "80C92353": "Must have been ten thousand tons of scrap. Twenty? I don't know.",
    "80C92354": "I can't believe it. I don't mind that he was Awoken, but an artist? I mean, come on!",
    "80C92355": "Sucked him right into the fans.",
    "80C92356": "My feet are killing me. Why haven't we rediscovered any Golden Age shoe technology?",
    "80C92357": "He's got plenty of charisma, but you're not even listening to me, are you?",
    "80C92358": "I'm just trying to enjoy the view.",
    "80C92359": "They found Fallen tracks in the sewers. That's why they put the turrets down there.",
    "80C9235A": "This could be my last night in the Tower.",
    "80C9235B": "Daito still hasn't got that factory back online.",
    "80C9235C": "I know! She's been dominating the Crucible this week!",
    "80C9235D": "Do you ever think maybe we'd be better off if the Traveler had never come?",
    "80C9235E": "They passed the third-stage Cryptarch exam—I'm so proud of them.",
    "80C9235F": "It's the Vex that scares me the most, to be honest. At least we can understand the other ones.",
    "80C92360": "There was a bunch of Titans standing at the station this morning—just silent, standing there waiting for something.",
    "80C92361": "Do Guardians ever do escort missions?",
    "80C92362": "His paintings are all bones and rags and crowns—he calls it Hive Art. It's hard to look at, but he says that's the point.",
    "80C92363": "I just got a nice message from Devrim. He seems safe enough. He needs more tea out there, I guess.",
    "80C92364": "The City is so weak. What if someone else comes to finish the job?",
    "80C92365": "They say they won't be taken by surprise again. But they would say that, wouldn't they?",
    "80C92366": "The Traveler wasn't there for us until it was almost too late.",
    "80C92367": "Some requistion from a Warlock Asher Mir? It's like 30 pages long, and I don't understand half of these words.",
    "80C92368": "Why didn't the Hunters see the Red Legion coming? Isn't that what they're THERE for?",
    "80C92369": "The Warlocks should have seen the Red Legion coming. They're supposed to be so wise and all-knowing.",
    "80C9236A": "The Titans promised us they'd defend the City; then they let the Red Legion destroy our home.",
    "80C9236B": "When are we going to accept it? The Guardians don't understand us.",
    "80C9236C": "I donate a tenth of my salary to Dead Orbit. It's all I can afford.",
    "80C9236D": "You all thought we were crazy. But now Dead Orbit seems pretty sane, right?",
    "80C9236E": "If we're going to stay here, we should be building more ships. That's all I'm saying.",
    "80C9236F": "I don't know who Arach Jalaal answers to. I don't want to know.",
    "80C92370": "Dead Orbit lost a lot of its leaders in the attack.",
    "80C92371": "Lakshmi-2 doesn't answer to the Vanguard. ",
    "80C92372": "I don't know who is in the inner circle. Nobody does.",
    "80C92373": "The War Cult does a great deal for charity; we just don't publicize it the way New Monarchy does.",
    "80C92374": "Did the Devices survive the attack? I can't get a clear answer.",
    "80C92375": "When was the last time you can remember we were at peace?",
    "80C92376": "Nobody cares about the City's poor. Except New Monarchy.",
    "80C92377": "We need a centralized City government. Now more than ever.",
    "80C92378": "I go to New Monarchy meetings, but I'm not, like, obsessed about it.",
    "80C92379": "I believe in Monarchy.",
    "80C9237A": "A strong leader lead us through to this new Golden Age. I believe that!",
    "80C9237B": "This is great!",
    "80C9237C": "That's impossible.",
    "80C9237D": "Oh, that's right...",
    "80C9237E": "I remember this.",
    "80C9237F": "This is all wrong.",
    "80C92380": "Good for her.",

    "80C92395": "Ikora's running point on that one. She'll make those Cabal regret coming here.",

    "80C92406": "You know there's a lot to explore right here, Hunter.",
    "80C92408": "Me? Look—I don't—I don't know what you want, Hunter. What? I'm nobody special.",
    "80C9240A": "I hear a lot of Hunters have gone missing. But they're just going undercover, right?",
    "80C9240B": "Zavala saved my life back in the old Tower.",
    "80C9240C": "I hear they found an old chamber on the lower levels and it was full of old Titan armor from a hundred years ago.",
    "80C9240D": "I don't think Commander Zavala's slept since the Tower fell.",
    "80C9240E": "Zavala's never going to quit, right?",
    "80C9240F": "You Titans are all right, right?",
    "80C92410": "Warlock, what happens to us if the Traveler dies? ",
    "80C92412": "What happens to Warlocks if the Traveler dies? Like, again. Do you lose your powers? Do you die too?",
    "80C92413": "I went to a War Cult meeting last night. They said, 'Time is like a flower.' Does that make any sense to you, Warlock?",
    "80C92415": "What? What? I hate when Warlocks stare like that.",
    "80C92416": "What does Ikora think about all this?",
    "80C92417": "I hear there are miles of underground levels here, and no one's charted them yet.",
    "80C92418": "I work for Cryptarch Babrius on her new metalogics. Cutting-edge stuff. We'll find a use for it some day.",
    "80C92419": "Part of the Cabal flagship fell on Fu'an District. Took out half a mile. Just terrible",
    "80C9241A": "I'm working for the new fleet in accounting, but still...",
    "80C9241B": "So what if I've never flown before? I've flown sims.",
    "80C9241D": "Salvage team goes to the old Tower tomorrow—they could probably use some security.",
    "80C9241E": "There was this illegal feed that I used to watch the Prison of Elders on but we lost the signal from the Reef because of the Cabal, and now I haven't seen it in weeks. I don't know why I just confessed that to you.",
    "80C9241F": "OK, look, maybe I copied some data out of the labs, but—wait—this isn't about that?",
    "80C92421": "We're never going to get out from under their thumb. Are we?",
    "80C92422": "Is it true what they're saying? They're still out there?",
    "80C92423": "They need everyone they can get.",
    "80C92424": "This Tower's my home now. Everything I knew in the City is gone.",
    "80C92425": "There's got to be something bad here, right?",
    "80C92426": "What about the other Towers, Guardian?",
    "80C92428": "It's way too hot in the hangar. There's still something going wrong in the air vents.",
    "80C9242A": "When the old Tower fell, I saw the roof cave in on me. I don't know how I survived.",
    "80C9242B": "I know this guy, in the old Tower he was a janitor. Now he runs half of procurement. Crazy, right?",
    "80C9242C": "Who else is out there? We need to bring them all home.",
    "80C9242D": "OK, hear me out: what if Oryx isn't dead?",
    "80C9242E": "I just—I can't believe it happened that way. We're all so close to death.",
    "80C9242F": "I don't really dream any more. I just wake up and it's dark everywhere, and I can't move.",
    "80FD0AD9": "He says we're going to drive the Cabal right off Mars!",
    "80C92433": "What really happened, Guardian? Why did the Legion retreat? ",
    "80C92435": "You should come down to Fu'an District some time, Guardian. See the races.",
    "80C92437": "Watch out ahead, Guardian. Radiation leak.",
    "80C92439": "Hey, Guardian, my brother runs the opera down in the Peregrine—I can get you tickets.",
    "80C9243B": "They're still fixing this area up. ",
    "80C9243C": "Have you seen a frame around here? I think it wandered this way.",
    "80C9243D": "I don't know what we're supposed to do. What does the future hold?",
    "80C9243E": "You play cards, Guardian?",
    "80C92440": "Aren't you the Guardian who beat Shaxx 3-2 in the Crucible last year? Yeah, thought so.",
    "80C92442": "Light protect you, Guardian. Light protect us all.",
    "80C92445": "The Cabal must be planning something—right, Hunter? You know, right?",
    "80C92447": "Planning something big out in the wilds?",
    "80C92448": "Welcome back, Hunter.",
    "80C9244A": "Find anything good in your travels?",
    "80C9244C": "What's your deal, Titan? Sunbreaker?",
    "80C9244E": "Show the Cabal what strength is, Titan.",
    "80C92450": "We're with you, Titan.",
    "80C92452": "Stand strong, Titan.",
    "80C92454": "Where are you off to, Titan?",
    "80C92456": "I've never met a Warlock with armor like yours before.",
    "80C92458": "Hey! You must be a Hunter, right? No, waitthat's not right.",
    "80C9245A": "Light's blessings, Warlock.",
    "80C9245C": "How are your studies going?",
    "80C9245D": "Thanks for your service, Warlock.",
    "80C9245F": "They're working to clear out the basement levels.",
    "80C92460": "We had a roof collapse in the upper levels last night.",
    "80C92461": "Look out, Guardian. This area is unstable.",
    "80C92463": "What's going on out at the Wall?",
    "80C92464": "Tell me the truth, Guardian. Will we ever win?",
    "80C92466": "My whole district burned when the Cabal hit.",
    "80C92467": "They say the war's over. Is that true?",
    "80C92468": "Show the Legion who's boss, Guardian.",
    "80C9246A": "So the war's over! What now?",
    "80C9246B": "Yes?",
    "80C9246C": "Hold on a minute.",
    "80C9246D": "Let me just—ah",

    "80C924A7": "Ship them out!",
    "80C924A8": "These orders come from Zavala personally.",
    "80C924A9": "They did OK in simulations.",

    "80C924CF": "Here we go.",
    "80C924D0": "We are putting you on Javelin-class ships today. Watch and do what she does. It's easy to make a mistake and in this case your slip-up could mean stranding a Guardian in orbit.",
    "80C924D1": "Ladies and gentlemen, you have been selected for flight training.  Listen up. I know all of you have run the sims for weeks, but I've never seen anyone make the transition without making a few big mistakes. We're here to train you, not watch you show off.",
    "80C924D2": "The fleet needs analysis, not guesswork. Get the numbers and crunch them, and check it twice; lives are at stake, and those lives protect yours and your families'.",
    "80C924D3": "The Vanguard needs solid data—like, yesterday. If you're having an issue with parsing reports, find a supervisor. We've got some new algorithms to test out that might save you some time.",
    "80C924D4": "All right, the H-60 swivel array. If you screw up the installation of this little guy,  the torpedos WILL explode in the launcher! If you think I'm joking, just wait and see. Holliday's not the only one around here with a leg made of plasteel.",
    "80C924D5": "All right! Yesterday, we covered basic terminology. Today, we've got weapon maintenance and practices to go through, and tomorrow, we'll look at munitions. I can see you yawning back there, Barstow. I'd be happy to relieve you if you'd rather be napping.",
    "80C924D6": "So I am going to show you examples of what happens if you don't pay attention to a Sparrow's drive mechanism! If you are sensitive, you may want to turn away for this; it's not pretty.",
    "80C924D7": "OK! Welcome back. Before we move on, listen up, everyone. This demonstration is going to show you the number one thing you must remember when servicing your flight suit! You do not want to find out what happens to people who forget to do this!",
    "80C924D8": "The lifts on the south side have been freezing between levels again, so we are running a full diagnostic. I've split up the B shift into 4 teams of 3, so you'll each have all the hands and eyes you need to be fast, clean, and safe. You got It? OK.",
    "80C924D9": "We're cleared to shut down the south elevator bank for an hour. This will have to be a quick repair. Don't be afraid to rely on a frame to pick up your slack. They've been tuned up and prepped for this task, and I worked alongside one last night—barely lifted a finger and I tested the work myself. Solid job. Let them work.",
    "80C924DA": "There is no hot water in the Vanguards' chambers, and yes, it IS our job to fix it. The last thing any of you want is for me to get another call from Ikora about not being able to make her tea. Trust me.",
    "80C924DB": "Look, you and I know that we're clueless about what half the systems in this old Tower do. Doesn't mean we stop. Figure them out and then fix them, it's as simple as that. There's no manual, so just use your heads and you'll get there.",
    "80C924DC": "OK! Higgins, you're on maintenance in Bay 3 today. The doors have been grinding in there, and I'm sick of hearing complaints about the noise, even if it's still safe in there.  Poeller, you're his shift relief, so keep an ear out in case he needs you. I want it done fast.",
    "80C924DD": "Bring up the specs on your feed. I'll wait a minute. You see those? Memorize them. I need these to all operate exactly the same, or we'll be tuning them backwards and forwards constantly for the rest of the month until we end up shutting them down and doing this all over again. Let's take our time and be careful.",
    "80C924DE": "Until we find a solution to the ventilation issues, we are just going to have to check the systems daily. I know it's not fast or fun, but if we don't do it, people are going to start getting sick, and that's just not an option.  We clear? It should only be one or two more weeks, tops.",
    "80C924DF": "That residue is building up in the vents again. Let's go scrape it out... Wear your masks; I will not be able to help you with any complaints about coughs or sore eyes if you're not following safety precautions.",
    "80C924E0": "All right, let's go.",
    "80C924E1": "That's all!",
    "80C924E2": "All right! That's it.",
    "80C924E3": "OK! And we're done.",

    "80C924EF": "The rains flooded the crater in Fu'an District. I hear they're going out in boats now.",
    "80C924F0": "I get the pills from someone in medical. There just isn't time to sleep anymore.",
    "80C924F1": "I keep getting lost. I keep thinking I'm in the old Tower.",
    "80C924F2": "If there's another blackout tonight people are going to lose it.",
    "80C924F3": "I never thought I'd see so many ships in one place.",
    "80C924F4": "I don't know who's in charge these days, but they need to fix the comms towers.",
    "80C924F5": "Found a little colony of frogs in one of the vent shafts.",

    "80C924F7": "It was Golden Age art. I didn't understand any of it.",
    "80C924F8": "Some of these Frames are getting weird. They should wipe them and start over.",
    "80C924F9": "What was that Frame leaking? It's never gonna come out.",
    "80C924FA": "I tell you, I know the problem. It's haunted.",

    "80C924FC": "She can take care of herself.",
    "80C924FD": "I mean, I think I know.",
    "80C924FE": "Whole shipment went missing.",
    "80C924FF": "I met him once. He seemed nice.",
    "80C92500": "If Holliday says get those old Kestrels in the air, that's what we'll do.",
    "80C92501": "Can Dead Orbit count on your support?",
    "80C92502": "Were you at the War Cult meeting last night?",
    "80C92503": "Going to Zavala's big speech tonight?",
    "80C92504": "It was some kind of machine. Must have been left over since the last time Guardians used this Tower.",
    "80C92505": "No word from Ishtar?",

    "80C92509": "Did you see him do his impression of Zavala?",
    "80C9250A": "They lost another convoy.",
    "80C9250B": "What do you think happened to the Speaker?",
    "80C9250C": "Waiting for them to come back—that's the hardest part.",
    "80C9250D": "The Fallen took the whole crew. ",
    "80C9250E": "Do you ever get the sense that the Guardians that they don't really see the rest of us?",
    "80C9250F": "I see all these Guardians around, and I know it shouldn't, but it scares me. ",
    "80C92510": "Oh, kids in the corridors playing 'Cabal and Guardians'. Yeah, don't worry.",
    "80C92511": "The Speaker would have known what to do.",
    "80C92512": "My sister told me there's some kinda shard from the Traveler out in Europe. How'd it get all the way out there?",
    "80C92513": "Why are we sending Guardians to die? Why?",
    "80C92514": "Nothing's been the same since the Red Legion.",
    "80C92515": "Kids everywhere in this new Tower. Guess a lot of them lost their parents.",

    "80C9251D": "Said he made it to Io. The Arachs will want to talk to him.",
    "80C9251E": "I mean the War Cult TOLD us this was going to happen. And it's going to get worse.",

    "80C9253D": "I knew it!",
    "80C9253E": "Great!",
    "80C9253F": "I need a break.",
    "80C92540": "This is OK.",
    "80C92541": "Just a second.",
    "80C92542": "OK, then.",
    "80C92543": "Ah, good.",
    "80C92544": "Again?",
    "80C92545": "This is taking forever.",
    "80C92546": "I slept rough last night.",
    "80C92547": "[YAWN]",
    "80C92548": "Ugh.",
    "80C92549": "The fleet needs to step up patrols; we can't lose any more supplies.",
    "80C9254A": "They showed those new jumpships on the newsfeed. Impressive.",
    "80C9254C": "Saw them testing those new tanks out by the Wall last night. I love those things. ",
    "80C9254D": "Getting conflicting reports again.",
    "80C9254E": "They downplayed the casualties for the newsfeed.",
    "80C9254F": "They should put her in charge of the assault team.",
    "80C92550": "That's what happens if you try to fight on two fronts, right?",
    "80C92551": "Six months ago I was a school teacher. The Red War changed all that pretty fast.",
    "80C92552": "It doesn’t even have shields.",
    "80C92553": "We have to fight for ourselves.",
    "80C92554": "No one's heard from him since you know.",
    "80C92555": "Log it.",
    "80C92556": "Is this their first combat run?",
    "80C92557": "When does the offensive launch?",
    "80C92558": "Shh!",
    "80C92559": "Quiet!",
    "80C9255A": "Shh, Wait—wait!",
    "80C9255B": "Not now!",
    "80C9255C": "That's enough!",
    "80C9255D": "Not so loud!",
    "80C9255E": "OK, keep this quiet.",
    "80C9255F": "I swear that's what she said! Yes, tomorrow!",
    "80C92560": "Look, I don't want to get into trouble!",
    "80C92561": "She doesn’t know I took it.",
    "80C92562": "We've got to get there before they open it up.",
    "80C92563": "Come closer, quiet.",
    "80C92564": "Hey, hey—look.",
    "80C92565": "Come on, come on!",
    "80C92566": "Excuse me! Folks?",
    "80C92567": "Come take a look!",
    "80C92568": "Hey you! Come here!",
    "80C92569": "This is gonna be good!",
    "80C9256A": "Come take a look at this!",
    "80C9256B": "Hey! Hey! Over here!",
    "80C9256C": "You'd better check this out.",
    "80C9256D": "ID checks out. Thanks, Guardian. ",
    "80C9256F": "Some kids were playing Guardians and Cabal. Cute. I guess.",
    "80C92570": "Crowds gathering up ahead, Guardian. Didn't look happy. ",
    "80C92572": "How's it going out there?",
    "80C92573": "All good, Guardian?",
    "80C92575": "Nice weather, isnt it?",
    "80C92576": "I think folks feel safer, seeing us around. ",
    "80C92578": "I thought Hunters knew everything. How come you didn't know the Cabal were coming?",
    "80C92579": "What are you looking for, Hunter? I can help!",
    "80C9257B": "You got a fast ship, Hunter?",
    "80C9257D": "I thought nothing could beat the Titans. Then the Tower fell.",
    "80C9257E": "I heard about the fight at the old Tower—about Zavala's shield.",
    "80C9257F": "You're a Titan, right? I just—thanks. Thanks for everything.",
    "80C92581": "I bet nothing's scary to you, huh?",
    "80C92582": "I thought Warlocks could see the future. But you didn't see the Cabal coming.",
    "80C92583": "I know you'll find the answers, Warlock.",
    "80C92585": "The Vanguard is much better off with Ikora Rey than with Osiris. ",
    "80C92586": "Hey, Warlock, I've always wanted to know—what the heck is the Void?",
    "80C92588": "They just relocated my project from the Umbral District.  I don't know my way around here yet.",
    "80C92589": "I'm in a band. We play down in the Southern district. You should come check us out!",
    "80C9258A": "Hey, why don't Guardians come down into the City more often?",
    "80C9258B": "My opa says our family used to live on Mars. You ever been there?",
    "80C9258D": "I'm nobody special, Guardian. I just do maintenance.",
    "80C9258F": "Do you have a Sparrow? Can I see it?",
    "80C92590": "Oh. A Guardian wants to talk to ME. Wow.",
    "80C92592": "Did you see that? Never mind. I'm imagining things.",
    "80C92594": "How long have you been alive? I heard Zavala's been around for centuries. ",
    "80C92595": "You might know. How many of the rumors are true?",
    "80C92596": "I never thought I'd work here. The Red War changed things.",
    "80C92597": "Over half the generators are still offline after the attack. ",
    "80C92598": "They're still sleeping six to a tent down there. We need to do something.",
    "80C92599": "I heard something about a Traveler Shard. Are we, like are we putting it back together?",
    "80C9259B": "I had people in the Umbral District when it started raining Traveler pieces.",
    "80C9259D": "Wow, Guardian—I, uh, I saw you fighting at the old Plaza. It was—wow.",
    "80C9259F": "If I don't fix this quick, there's going to be another power failure.",
    "80C925A0": "I've got to finish this for Lakshmi-2. ",
    "80C925A1": "Sorry Guardian. I can't lose count.",
    "80C925A3": "I'm on break in a couple of hours.",
    "80C925A4": "No time to talk.",
    "80C925A5": "I just work here, Guardian.",
    "80C925A7": "No one in the whole City is going to give you a better price.",
    "80C925A8": "I can give you an installment plan.",
    "80C925A9": "No one in the City is going to give you a better deal. And where else are you gonna go, right?",
    "80C925AA": "That's the cheapest. I mean, if you think that's all your family deserves, who am I to argue.",
    "80C925AB": "I have to feed my family, pal.",
    "80C925AD": "Take it, take it, it's a deal.",
    "80C925AE": "OK, I'll take 10 percent off.",
    "80C925AF": "Fifty percent now and 50 percent when the shipment comes in.",
    "80C925B0": "Oh, come on!",
    "80C925B1": "Whoa.",
    "80C925B2": "Slow down!",
    "80C925B3": "What the—",
    "80C925B4": "The Vanguard really needs to give us more resources.",
    "80C925B5": "Some cowards attacked them this morning. We're still looking for them.",
    "80C925B6": "We're all secure here, Guardian.",
    "80C925B8": "Do you need me to run a check on anything?",
    "80C925B9": "Do you need a security check, Guardian?",
    "80C925BB": "Everyone thinks Marcus Ren has left his SRL days behind him, but I saw him racing his Sparrow along the wall the other night. ",
    "80C925BC": "I met Ana Bray once. She was visiting the Bray family in the Peregrine District. ",
    "80C925BD": "I heard they found an old weapons lab. You should check it out.",
    "80C925BE": "You must be good with a rifle, right? What's the furthest you ever got a kill at?",
    "80C925C0": "I… I don't know anything, Hunter. Really, I don't.",
    "80C925C2": "Did you know more than half of Zavala's private quarters are full of paper books? My cousin's a bookseller; she sees him twice a month. ",
    "80C925C3": "I know people. If there's anything we can do to help the Titans, let me know.",
    "80C925C4": "I saw what happened at the old Tower—when Zavala made that shield. Can you all do that?",
    "80C925C5": "I saw a Titan break a steel plate with his bare skull once! Yeah, Shaxx was in a real mood that day. ",
    "80C925C6": "Do you know what they look like under their armor? I mean, really?",
    "80C925C7": "I tried to investigate Osiris, but the files in the Archive are full of contradictions, and the Vanguard won't speak of him.  ",
    "80C925C8": "I run a tea house on the 30th level. Ikora Rey orders tea leaves from us in bulk. ",
    "80C925C9": "Omolon Foundry does most of its business with Warlocks. They like the liquid fuel, I think.",
    "80C925CA": "Are you one of Ikora Rey's Hidden, Warlock? If you told me, would you have to kill me? Uh, forget I asked. ",
    "80C925CC": "Are you a Thanatonaut, Warlock? What happens when Guardians die? ",
    "80C925CE": "Why do Guardians like high places like this? Do you need to be closer to the Traveler? Do you get your powers from it? ",
    "80C925CF": "Did you see the Sparrow races last night? Some Hunter flamed out halfway down the vent.",
    "80C925D0": "My kid takes classes up here, near the Bazaar. She's getting really good!",
    "80C925D1": "My sister just got in yesterday! I'm so proud!",
    "80C925D2": "I used to be an actor down in the City. But the war changed all that.",
    "80C925D3": "Do you think I might be a Guardian after I die?",
    "80C925D5": "Have you ever been to the Reef? I wonder what it's like out there. ",
    "80C925D7": "Do you ever watch the Crucible, Guardian? ",
    "80C925D9": "You Guardians are really strong, right? How much can you lift?",
    "80C925DA": "Nice costume, by the way. Oh, wait—are you really a Guardian?",
    "80C925DC": "I just opened up a childcare service. We're already swamped. ",
    "80C925DD": "People say, how could the Red Legion have gotten so close without us knowing it? Well OK. Listen. What if they came from INSIDE THE EARTH?",
    "80C925DE": "They housed a bunch down in an old generator room. ",
    "80C925DF": "Listen, if I was Zavala, I'd just burn them all. Roast them in their armor!",
    "80C925E0": "New Monarchy puts on a pretty good victory celebration, Guardian. You should check it out.",
    "80C925E2": "They're rebuilding in Fu'an. That Cabal hull is still there though.",
    "80C925E3": "It's going to be years before they fix all the damage the Cabal did to the City. But now we have time.",
    "80C925E5": "Is it true there's a new planet out in the beyond?",
    "80C925E6": "What do we expect to find out there?",
    "80C925E7": "Did you see a messenger go by? I gave it the wrong package.",
    "80C925E8": "Did I see you in a Crucible replay the other day? Hmm, maybe not.",
    "80C925E9": "I have clearance to be here, Guardian.",
    "80C925EB": "They're fixing up a new launch bay—it's pretty exciting to watch.",
    "80C925EC": "I can't get used to this place.",
    "80C925ED": "Hey! Guardian! It's an honor.",
    "80C925EF": "Where do you think they're sending them next?",
    "80C925F0": "Whoa! I'm not doing anything.",
    "80C925F1": "Wow—I can't believe I just ran into you!",
    "80C925F2": "Where will the Cabal hit next? You know, right?",
    "80C925F3": "You should take a break, Hunter.",
    "80C925F5": "Hey—can you Hunters really teleport?",
    "80C925F6": "You look like you found something bad out there.",
    "80C925F7": "Want to settle a bet for me, Hunter?",
    "80C925F9": "Did you hear the Commander's big speech last night?",
    "80C925FB": "Zavala was on his way down to check out the fleet.",
    "80C925FC": "I hear there's a big offensive in the works.",
    "80C925FD": "Stand firm, Titan.",
    "80C925FF": "Anything we can do to help, Titan?",
    "80C92601": "I saw Ikora Rey heading to that new chamber on the south side.",
    "80C92602": "You guys scare me a little, to be honest.",
    "80C92603": "Light go with you, Warlock. ",
    "80C92605": "I keep having these weird dreams about the Traveler.",
    "80C92606": "What's going to happen next, Warlock?",
    "80C92608": "The repair teams haven't slept for a week, and the new chambers are still barely habitable.",
    "80C92609": "My family's still down in Fu'an District. Or what's left of it after the Red Legion.",
    "80C9260A": "The Traveler will talk to us now, right? Right?",
    "80C9260B": "I haven't seen my family since the Red Legion hit.",
    "80C9260C": "We'll need all the help we can get.",
    "80C9260D": "We all lost people when the Cabal hit.",
    "80C9260E": "They're saying you flew right into the sun to stop the Cabal—is that true?",
    "80C92610": "Where are they going? And when will they be back?",
    "80C92611": "A Golden Age creation forgotten in the Collapse. That's my theory.",
    "80C92612": "Yes, Guardian! You guys took the Light to the Cabal and you LIT THEM UP.",
    "80C92614": "Didn't mean to be rude. Kinda rushed.",
    "80C92615": "What's the emergency?",
    "80C92616": "Sorry, I need to finish this. ",
    "80C92617": "I just need to enter this data.",
    "80C92618": "I just need to close this out.",
    "80C92619": "This zone is top security right now, Guardian.",
    "80C9261B": "All secure, Guardian.",
    "80C9261D": "Yes, Guardian!",
    "80C9261F": "What can I do for you?",
    "80C92620": "Greetings, Guardian.",
    "80C92622": "We'll take it from here, Guardian. ",
    "80C92624": "If you can get me a discount, I'll put in a good word for you with New Monarchy.",
    "80C92625": "Can I try the other one?",
    "80C92626": "How much is that?",
    "80C92627": "How much is that going to cost?",
    "80C92628": "I just need something that'll work. I don't care how it looks.",
    "80C92629": "We all have to do our part these days.",
    "80C9262A": "Thank YOU.",
    "80C9262B": "No thank YOU.",
    "80C9262C": "I was happy to help.",

    "80C92632": "[thinking, working effort] Alright.",
    "80C92633": "There we go good oh, no.",
    "80C92634": "I think that's right.",
    "80C92635": "That should work",
    "80C92636": "Huh, let's see.",
    "80C92637": "Just about got it, I think.",
    "80C92638": "124, 125, 126...",
    "80C92639": "Con…cen…trate.",

    "80C9263E": "Alright, got to get this.",
    "80C9263F": "I can do this.",
    "80C92640": "This'll work.",
    "80C92641": "This is bad. I don't want to be the one who tells the Executor about this.",
    "80C92642": "Oops. Uh, well that's no good. ",
    "80C92643": "Does the vertigo ever go away?",
    "80C92644": "This data doesn't make any sense.",
    "80C92645": "This part is defective. ",
    "80C92646": "These need an upgrade before they're ready to fight the Red Legion.",
    "80C92647": "They need those shields at the EDZ.",
    "80C92648": "They did great in simulations against the Cabal.",
    "80C92649": "This is some new anti-Phalanx tech.",
    "80C9264A": "Link up the shields and see what happens.",
    "80C9264B": "Get the guidance system online.",
    "80C9264C": "Never thought I'd be doing this.",

    "80C9264E": "These Kestrels outclass a Ketch, but a Red Legion harvester? Not a chance.",
    "80C9264F": "It'll do. It's not like it's going to fight the Red Legion head-on anyhow.",
    "80C92650": "OK. OK [GRUNT OF EFFORT]",
    "80C92651": "I need better tools.",

    "80C9265B": "What do think this machine does?",
    "80C9265C": "We've got conflicting orders. So we're going to go with Holliday's.",
    "80C9265D": "You think you can do it within budget?",
    "80C9265E": "You think you can get it done with that budget?",
    "80C9265F": "Is that deadline going to work?",
    "80C92660": "You think you can do it in that deadline?",

    "80C92664": "Let's get it done quick so we can end our shift.",
    "80C92665": "I had to pull strings to get the supplies for this.",
    "80C92666": "Maybe nobody's in charge now. That just means we have to do things for ourselves.",

    "80C92668": "You run into any problems with that job?",
    "80C92669": "OK! Come on!",
    "80C9266A": "OK, Listen!",
    "80C9266B": "I need your attention for one moment!",
    "80C9266C": "Everyone, listen, can I have your attention!",
    "80C9266D": "OK, settle down now.",
    "80C9266E": "Congratulations, ensigns: this is your last round of sim training before live air maneuvers. Today's test is going to be a bit special. You won't be piloting today. You'll be put in command of a larger space vessel, and you'll have to solve a specific scenario. I'll be posting a schedule for private test times.  Good luck, and I'll see you at the sims.",
    "80C9266F": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for trying out for the flight. In a moment we'll have you all checked out by medical. Once again, lying on an application form about your health issues will not help the fleet. Be honest. Some folks aren't cut out to be soldiers, and you're not helping anyone by putting them at risk with your good intentions.  We've seen what our enemies can do to us in our homes, and not everyone can keep a cool head in the face of that. We are trained to know what makes safe fighters and what makes dead ones, so please, let us do our jobs.",
    "80C92670": "You may think you know how to fly. You grew up playing those ludosims—Ketch versus Kestrel, Outlaw Flight, all that. But let me tell you—real flying is nothing like the games. You're going to have to learn everything all over again, and you're going to fail hard before you succeed. I'll be honest, not everyone makes it into a cockpit. I wish you the best of luck, and a chance to make up for what happened to our home, here. Work hard, work smart, and I hope to see you in the air.",
    "80C92671": "This reconnaissance mission is going to be overseen by Ikora Rey herself. Our ships have been outfitted with special scanners that she designed by hand personally. We just need to get our there and point them at the Cabal, then stay alive long enough for the Vanguard to get the intel they need. It's not safe, fun, or easy, and you'll be watched like a hawk while you do it. Any questions? Good. Read your briefings, and get suited up.",
    "80C92672": "These new Javelins accelerate about 20 percent faster than the old model, which is great—just don't forget it. Take some time today to get used to the new maneuverability and thrust. There will be an adjustment period, but I think you're going to like these new ones a lot better if you can prove you won't kill yourself getting out of the hangar bay.",
    "80C92673": "Those Fallen transmissions we intercepted last week just got back from a run through the Cryptarchs. The good news is they were able to crack them; the bad news is they're full of bad news. It turns out this House of Dusk has got itself a would-be Archon with delusions of grandeur and a Ketch-load of scavenged weaponry to fill all four hands of his crew with.  So, our combat squads top priority today is to reacquaint the good Fallen with reality, in the form of boson torpedos applied liberally to their formerly secret hideout. Great work on that intel, E Team, this one's all yours.",
    "80C92674": "With some things, no amount of engineering is going to improve them. And this is one. Report to Dr. Kazuyuki on the schedule posted before you suit up for flight. Thank you, and good luck up there.",
    "80C92675": "There's no evidence the Red Legion have cracked our encryption. Hell, those big dumb beasts can barely understand our language. But just to be safe, we're changing all the encryption codes across the fleet. Starting today. Rumor has it the Cryptarchs have been tapped to lend their help with the algorithms, so this might get a little complex compared to what you're used to.  Be patient, this is for the greater good.",
    "80C92676": "Bad news. It looks like some pipeworks were routed incorrectly, so instead of fresh hot water, the showers in the Hunters' barracks are passing through 30 percent acidic waste runoff. No one's permanently damaged, but I had some very angry calls waiting for me this morning. Their Ghosts solved any bodily damage, but we now owe them a couple new capes.  I know these new blueprints are unfamiliar to most of us, but next time you're referencing a drainage system diagram, make sure it's turned the right way around.",
    "80C92677": "We just found out that some folks in the Peregrine district had exploited the generator systems to distribute them more than their allocated power share. I don't have to tell you how angry the other district administrators were when they figured it out. So we're installing new firmware in the distributor hubs at each power station to prevent that from happening again.  I need logs on each install, so do not forget to pull them down before you soft-reset. Clear?",
    "80C92678": "I've got reports that the nutrigel machines are malfunctioning, giving the gel a weird taste. Now, if I'm being honest, I kind of like the new flavor. I mean, at least it's a change of pace. But orders are orders. Lee, Montero, and Shen, you're assigned to the issue. Repairs to the food system are your top priority, before returning to tools inventory.",
    "80C92679": "Bad news, team. The Frames have been determined to be too heavy for the suspension equipment we've got on hand to do cleanup of the southeastern spires.  Whitmore, you're our resident expert on the safety harnesses, so take Dovidoff and Rowe and whoever else you need to get fitted for gear and prepare for a slow ride up. Be safe and be smart, and I guess try not to look down if you can help it.",
    "80C9267A": "Hello, folks, and welcome to the wild and wonderful world of safe waste disposal. Now, I can imagine what comes to mind when you think of what this detail involves. Well, my new friends, a lot more than you think gets disposed of in this Tower. I can assure you, the dangers go well beyond unpleasant aromas. Just for starters, you should see what kind of crazy stuff the Warlocks on 112th throw out!1",
    "80C9267B": "This is the F-44. It differs from the F-30 in several respects. One: it has a flange. Two: it explodes much less frequently if it overheats. Three: it has been known to cause severe nerve damage on contact with skin when activated. So it goes without saying, be careful, wear your masks and gloves, and let the Frames help you with installation. No slip-ups today, ok?",
    "80C9267C": "Okay, I need the big brains up in front for a minute. The situation is this: we need to improve the performance on the K-22's and G-12's. But we won't be getting new fuel cell chargers until next month. So we're going to have to do this the hard way. The target is a 12 to 15 percent increase. Any ideas? Ruiz, you beefed up that solar grid last week, right? Maybe you can take a look at this for me?",
    "80C9267D": "Right—we're done.",
    "80C9267E": "Let's get started.",

    "80C92688": "Copy that, Tower. He's headed that way. ",
    "80C92689": "This is Patrol TF-7, reporting in.",

    "80C92697": "I stayed up way too late last night.",
    "80C92698": "Wait—WHO changed the codes? Who said he could do that?",
    "80C92699": "Nothing but white light. Then I woke up.",
    "80C9269A": "The shuttle is an hour late.",
    "80C9269B": "Are you settling into your new place okay?",
    "80C9269C": "We can do another 15 percent.",
    "80C9269D": "I just can't get used to this. The recipe's not the same, you know?",
    "80C9269E": "Heard you were checking out the War Cult.",
    "80C9269F": "Shaxx should open more Crucible arenas on Earth.",
    "80C926A0": "We don't know what half the systems actually do. Nobody has any specs.",
    "80C926A1": "They opened an old chamber in the sub-basement—someone had painted NINE-NINE-NINE on the walls, over and over.",

    "80C926A3": "I don't have time to watch the newsfeeds since I joined the fleet.",
    "80C926A4": "They were shouting, 'Escape this Dead Orbit!' Now is that pro-Dead Orbit, the faction, or against?",
    "80C926A5": "I don't want him to enlist. He should leave it to the Guardians. ",
    "80C926A7": "Has anybody ever tried TALKING to the Fallen? Maybe we could make peace!",
    "80C926A8": "He claimed they were Golden Age. Ha! Like I was going to fall for that one.",
    "80C926A9": "They're putting up tents wherever they can. Dead Orbit donated most of them.",
    "80C926AA": "We should search for our common ground. Not the things that drive us apart.",
    "80C926AB": "So we find out something killed a bunch of Red Legion, and then we go looking for it! Are we crazy?",
    "80C926AC": "The Traveler—it's it's so beautiful. ",
    "80C926AD": "Those bunkers are centuries old, but they served us well when the Red Legion came. ",
    "80C926AE": "If only the Red Legion and the Hive had crossed paths before they ever got here!",
    "80C926AF": "Hey, ah, I'm really sorry for the loss of your—",
    "80C926B0": "I haven't had a good night's sleep since the Attack. Every time I close my eyes, I see the Red Legion. ",

    "80C8F039": "All the Factions are war profiteers, if you ask me!",
    "80C8F03A": "My whole neighborhood was leveled in the Red Legion attack. We're living out of this ancient bunker beneath the Fu'an Hospital. ",

    "80C8F07B": "I took my Golden Age family heirloom to the Cryptarchs—turns out it's just a piece of junk.",
    "80C8F07C": "I hear they cracked open a door on one of the upper levels and found a huge room of Warlock stuff and hundreds of bird skeletons.",
    "80C8F07E": "I have a theory. They say there's a Shard of the Traveler in Europe. Well—what if it's a Traveler egg?",
    "80C8F07F": "Cryptarch Yareli says the Fallen language is changing. What does that even mean?",
    "80C8F080": "They're building a memorial to Red Legion's victims down in Umbral—all holos and light.",
    "80C8F081": "I'm just going to check the feed if that's OK. ",
    "80C8F082": "What's it like having a Ghost? Does your Ghost have a name? Are you its first Guardian, or did it have others before you?",
    "80C8F084": "I always thought Guardians would be taller. Not that there's anything wrong with that.",
    "80C8F085": "I was trapped under a collapsed building for two days after the attack. I thought I was going to die. ",
    "80C8F086": "My son keeps telling me he wants to grow up to be a Titan. I don't know what to say to him. I mean, clearly it doesn't work that way, but how do I tell him?  Think maybe your Ghost would speak with him?",
    "80C8F087": "Had you ever even heard of the Red Legion before? The Cabal are more complicated than we thought.",
    "80C8F089": "My children went missing in the attack, Guardian. We're still looking.",

    "80C8F127": "OK, in just a few days we'll be suiting you up and testing you out. In the meantime, my recommendation is to hit the simulator and re-read all your training docs. Good luck!",

I don't know if there's anything we can do to help him, but there's no way I'm telling him that. Just give it a look-see. Thanks.",

    "80FD0B0E": "The burning of the Fallen banners is fascinating. The degradation of Eliksni culture began generations ago, with the event they call the Whirlwind. The dissolution of the Houses is just a new chapter for this sad, bedeviled race.",
    "80FD0B10": "The Vanguard held the City together for generation after generation of citizenry. It wasn't always Commander Zavala at the helm, of course. But one way or another, the Vanguard kept us together.",
    "80FD0B12": "What little we know of the Cabal history is written in blood. They have always been conquerors. You know of the Psions, yes? The strange, small attendant creatures? They are an entirely different race, but part of the empire just the same. Who knows how many worlds the Red Legion have visited?",
    "80FD0B14": "The history of this continent is fascinating, Guardian. Have you ever reviewed the archives of the Cryptarchy? Wars, plague, political unrest. But greatness, as well. Across the ancient world, greatness could be found. Art, culture, music even those like myself may never truly reclaim that which we lost in the Collapse.",
    "80FD0B16": "This history of the Vex cannot be contained within the pages of a book. How can beings such as these—digital life forms—even be said to have a history? All we know for sure is that they seek nothing less than total victory. But to what end?",
    "80FD0B18": "When I think of what lurks in the dark, the face it wears is that of the Hive. Though we have stood time and again against their princes and kings, the sorcery of that foul race will always be a threat. History tells us so.",
    "80FD0B1A": "What are the Taken? In a world without their king, what is their purpose? And without a purpose, what is their future? Or their past? I fear that has yet to be written, Guardian.",
    "80FD0B1C": "The Awoken people bear up under a history of hope. The brave sacrifice of their queen in defense of our solar system — a day we shall always remember. My fear now turns towards their future. What cost have they paid in this 'Red War'?",
    "80FD0B1E": "Would that I could, I would tell you the origin of the Exo. But much like their purpose, history has shadowed that from my sight. Somewhere, beyond our understanding, lies their truth. And I believe it is a truth that matters to us all.",
    "80FD0B20": "I wish you a happy Dawning.",
    "80FD0B21": "The Traveler shines on us this Dawning.",
    "80FD0B22": "Enjoying the snow?",
    "80FD0B23": "Happy Dawning to you.",
    "80FD0B24": "Happy Dawning, Guardian.",
    "80FD0B26": "May hope and joy find you this Dawning.",
    "80FD0B27": "Happy Crimson Days.",
    "80FD0B28": "Best of luck to you and your Crimson Bond.",
    "80FD0B29": "Happy Crimson Days to you, Guardian!",
    "80FD0B2B": "Have you made your Bond yet?",
    "80FD0B2D": "Two are stronger than one.",
    "80FD0B2E": "Bright and joyful Crimson Days to you!",
    "80FD0B2F": "What news, Guardian?",
    "80FD0B31": "Yes, Light-bearer? ",
    "80FD0B33": "Do you wish me to decrypt something?",
    "80FD0B35": "Do you have a story to tell?",
    "80FD0B37": "Do you want me to write something down?",
    "80FD0B39": "How has the battlefield fared?",
    "80FD0B3B": "Anything worthy of a closer look?",
    "80FD0B3D": "Such a wonderful time of year. You can sense goodwill everywhere around you.",
    "80FD0B3E": "It's good to see a bit of snow again. I've missed the Iron Temple.",
    "80FD0B3F": "The Dawning represents so many things: hope for a new future, shared joy, togetherness We've needed this.",
    "80FD0B40": "The other Cryptarchs were astonishingly helpful with the arrangements for this Dawning. The Red War brought out a different side of them.",
    "80FD0B41": "We lost so many friends in the Red War. These celebrations feel empty without them.",
    "80FD0B42": "Someone asked me earlier if there were any songs related to the Dawning. It hadn't even occurred to me. I'll have to check the archives.",
    "80FD0B43": "Crimson Days is my favorite holiday. Nothing can match the power of two Guardians working together in harmony.",
    "80FD0B44": "There are as many stories that describe the origin of Crimson Days as there are Ghosts looking for Guardians. I'm sure someone somewhere remembers the truth.",
    "80FD0B45": "I believe our Crimson Days are a modern continuation of a much older celebration, but the archives are quite confusing. I have references to cow herders and chocolate, which— Surely they can't be related, can they?",
    "80FD0B46": "During the Red War, I worried that we would lose traditions like the Crimson Days. It's good that we've found peace again.",
    "80FD0B47": "Make sure you don't miss out on Crimson Doubles. This is your chance to make history.",
    "80FD0B48": "I haven't exchanged a letter with Saladin in some time. Perhaps the holiday is an excuse to write him again",
    "80FD0B49": "There are so many things that don't add up.",
    "80FD0B4B": "What secrets could we find below the Shard?",
    "80FD0B4D": "The past is no guide. We are beyond the edge of the map.",
    "80FD0B4F": "I spent so much time mired in the past. What did it teach me?",
    "80FD0B51": "Future historians will want to know. They will read my words.",
    "80FD0B53": "The data is replaceable. The people are not.",
    "80FD0B55": "The archives will never recover. To have lost so much",
    "80FD0B57": "I've learned so much. One day, I will write the history of the City's fall.",
    "80FD0B59": "The threat seems large enough. If I had access to VOLUSPA-level systems— No.",
    "80FD0B5B": "I could use my time here. Crack that Clovis Bray encryption scheme",
    "80FD0B5D": "The Great Machine, alight atop the world. A beacon of hope. But Light shines brightly in the Darkness.",
    "80FD0B5F": "Yes, dear. White Queen to h5. What? Don't get sarcastic with me, young lady.",
    "80FD0B61": "Is this truly a Golden Age? Does it even care? What does it mean?",
    "80FD0B63": "'You never miss Herodotus until he's gone.' Will they say the same of Tyra Karn?",
    "80FD0B65": "If Gibbon or Olmstead were here, what would they write? What would they say of this new era of humanity?",
    "80FD0B67": "I wonder what happened to Efrideet, to Shiro.",
    "80FD0B69": "I will age now. My histories will go unfinished. Already my bones begin to ache.",
    "80FD0B6B": "What if the Traveler wakes? Beautiful. But what could follow?",
    "80FD0B6D": "If I'm going to die, I'm at least going to be useful before I go. Hmph.",
    "80FD0B6F": "This place is so beautiful. If I must pass beyond, at least it's a nice place to go.",
    "80FD0B71": "In the wake of the Red War, I have often thought about history's tendency to move in cycles. With every renaissance, there comes a fall. I wonder, are we falling still? Or are we climbing toward another Golden Age?",
    "80FD0B72": "It's a pity that we aren't in the habit of building statues for our heroes these days. ",
    "80FD0B73": "Rasputin Hmm. Now that is a puzzle to solve.",
    "80FD0B74": "I look forward to the day that Saladin and Efrideet visit me here. The Farm is homier than the Iron Temple ever was.",
    "80FD0B75": "The Exodus Black was carrying SIVA, I am sure of it. The only question is, where has it gone?",
    "80FD0B76": "Ana Bray I haven't heard that name in a long, long time. Didn't she go by something else before?",
    "80FD0B77": "Entire civilizations rose and fell for thousands of years before the Traveler arrived on Earth. Who were the people that lived here? Did they imagine this would be our future?",
    "80FD0B78": "I have no evidence to support this, but I can't help but believe that we drew the Red Legion into this system. They came because we called.",
    "80FD0B79": "What mysteries still await us in the European Dead Zone?",
    "80FD0B7A": "There is so much to study now. I am not sure where to focus my research.",
    "80FD0B7B": "History will remember this Guardian forever. I will make sure of it.",
    "80FD0B7D": "It is so quiet here now. At least at least I will have time to write.",
    "80FD0B7F": "I could call into the City or I could work on deciphering Legion cyber A-984. Hmm.",
    "80C13882": "Is there something you need?",
    "80C13884": "Consider my knowledge at your disposal.",
    "80C13886": "You make history, Guardian. Or you become its victim.",
    "80C13888": "Do you have something? A cipher, perhaps?",
    "80C1388A": "I am here to help.",
    "80C1388C": "I am here for you, of course.",
    "80C1388E": "Welcome.  ",
    "80C13890": "What do you seek? ",
    "80C13892": "What may I do for you?",
    "80C13894": "Let's begin.",
    "80C13896": "You have questions?",
    "80C13898": "History awaits.",
    "80C1389A": "Good, it's you. Let's begin the work.",
    "80FD0B81": "I hope the Dawning brings you peace and happiness, Guardian.",
    "80FD0B83": "There must always be someone to keep traditions like the Dawning alive, even if only for the little ones. They will be our future historians.",
    "80FD0B84": "What a change from the Red War, huh? I'd much rather see Guardians running and playing in the snow than frightened refugees huddling together. We're very lucky.",
    "80FD0B85": "I'd like to sneak off and start a snowball fight, but I've got work to do.",
    "80FD0B86": "The stories I keep, the stories of the past, are dark. How bright and lovely this Dawning is. It's a wonderful contrast to my usual work.",
    "80FD0B87": "Someone will make history in this year's Crimson Doubles. Will it be you?",
    "80FD0B88": "Now, don't spread this around too much, but someone sent me a bouquet of flowers. Me! After all these years, can you even imagine? [laughs]",
    "80FD0B89": "A Crimson Bond will make you stronger. We all need someone to have our back.",
    "80FD0B8B": "The truest history lies in our relationships to one another. It might not be written down, but we carry it in our bones and tell it through our actions. 'Are you there for me?' we ask each other. And for your Crimson Bond, your answer should be, 'Yes.'",
    "80FD0B8C": "None of us are truly able to stand alone in this world. Let us join hands in these Crimson Days to honor and celebrate those who give us strength.",
    "80FD0B8D": "We shall unravel that which is hidden.",
    "80FD0B8F": "How? How could I not have known the name Ghaul?",
    "80FD0B91": "No references to the Red Legion. None. How is that possible?",
    "80FD0B93": "We don't know what we've lost. We are that blind.",
    "80FD0B95": "I will look upon the Traveler again, someday. But until then, I am needed here.",
    "80FD0B97": "European Dead Zone. So little in the archives. An evacuation?",
    "80FD0B99": "It's good to have a bit of company. Stay as long as you like.",
    "80FD0B9A": "The Hero of the Red War has come down to the Farm, huh? Are you here to see me, or are you looking for a soccer ball?",
    "80FD0B9C": "I need a research assistant. [sighs] My archives are a mess!",
    "80FD0B9E": "Tell me, did you see any sign of SIVA when you traveled to Nessus? Ask that Failsafe if you go back. I must know.",
    "80FD0BA0": "The Gensym Scribes are renowned for their fastidious attention to detail, even among Cryptarchs. They're an obnoxious bunch, if you ask me.",
    "80FD0BA1": "I wonder if it's time for me to pay a visit to the Reef.",
    "80C138A8": "I believe this is fair.",
    "80C138AA": "I hope you have use for this.",
    "80C138AC": "This, for that. As it should be.",
    "80C138AE": "I have no use for this. May it serve you well.",
    "80C138B0": "From your Cryptarch, with her thanks.",
    "80C138B2": "A piece of history to guide our future.",
    "80C138B4": "A fine treasure, I believe.",
    "80C138B6": "I do hope it serves your needs. ",
    "80C138B8": "A fine decryption, for a fine Guardian.",
    "80C138BA": "Remember me as you use this, if you would.",
    "80C138BC": "Engrams are full of such treasures.",
    "80C138BE": "In appreciation for all that you have done, and will do.",
    "80C138C0": "Use it wisely. ",
    "80C138C2": "I can barely remember that feeling.",
    "80C138C4": "From your Cryptarch, with fondness.",
    "80C138C6": "Use it to guide our future. ",
    "80C138C8": "It meant something to someone, once. Now it is yours.",
    "80C138CA": "You are holding history now. ",
    "80C138CC": "It's seen more years than most of us.",
    "80C138CE": "Take care of it. There aren't many like it anymore.",
    "80C138D0": "Appreciate what you have now. It is fleeting. ",
    "80C138D2": "Farewell.",
    "80C138D4": "I'll be here when you return.",
    "80C138D6": "We are grateful.",
    "80C138D8": "The truth awaits.",
    "80C138DA": "The truth awaits.",
    "80C138DC": "Our history rests with you now.",
    "80C138DE": "Thank you.",
    "80C13D46": "I need your help with this.",
    "80C13D48": "We have a problem, and you can help.",
    "80C13D4A": "We're tracking something here. I think you can help.",
    "80C13D4C": "I have something here, just for you!",
    "80C13D4E": "I'm worried about this one. Help me out?",
    "80C13D50": "You. Would. Be. Perfect for this job!",
    "80C13D52": "Got a mission here with your name on it.",
    "80C13D54": "Were you gonna say something?",
    "80C13D56": "Can  can I help you? Or ?",
    "80C13D58": "Hey, sorry  I'm pretty busy. What's going on?",
    "80C13D5A": "Guardian. Oh  Guardian!",
    "80C13D64": "Hey Guardian, you in there?",
    "80C13D66": "I lost you. Didn't I? Come on back.",
    "80C13D68": "Your brain fell out, huh? Tragic.",
    "80C13D6A": "You'd make a fantastic perch for the bird at this rate.",
    "80C13D6C": "Are you trying to figure out how to talk to me? I have that problem with people too. Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite you.",
    "80C13D6E": "I survived on my own for  a long time, you know. Having smart, experienced people around me makes all the difference.",
    "80C13D70": "Back when I first left the City, if you told me I'd be here? In this place, doing this job? I'd have said you were nuts. But  I think I'm pretty good at it. And sometimes you just have to answer the call. You know?",
    "80C13D72": "Yeah, this place spaces me out too.",
    "80C13D74": "I'm trying not to let my edge dull, living behind the Walls again. But  just between you and me? Flavored yogurt is AMAZING.",
    "80C13D76": "I wouldn't be the me I am today, if I hadn't left. I've had people ask me if they should go, and I say  yes. There's whole wild world out there.",
    "80C13D78": "I'm chatting again with some friends I had growing up. Sometimes it's a little hard to connect. Like, they'll talk about a birthday they had a few years ago, and I'm like 'Yeah, I think that was the year I lived in a gulley and mostly ate ferrets.'",
    "80C13D7A": "I honestly didn't think Clans would survive the move back to the City. But  Zavala was right. More every day, even some civilian Clans down in the City. Folks just want to have common ground.",
    "80C13D7C": "I had dinner with Devrim's husband last night. Same kitchen I grew up in. It meant more than I thought it would, going home again.",
    "80C13D7E": "Zavala's less of a stick in the mud than I expected. I think I even saw him smile yesterday.",
    "80C13D80": "Ikora's kinda what I wanna be when I grow up. Smart, scary  melt people with her mind. Everything a little girl dreams of.",
    "80C13D82": "Cayde is exactly like I remember from when I was a kid. Exactly. Like I never left. (sigh)",
    "80C13D5C": "When we first got here, I started the clans as a way to make people feel ... safer. A way to let them know we were all in this together. And, of course, to prove I was right. Haha.",
    "80C13D5E": "My favorite clans are the ones that stand for something. That stand together in combat and in comradery Those are the clans that last.",
    "80C13D60": "You ever think your clanmates are a little weird? Don't worry, Guardian. Everybody's weird.",
    "80C13D62": "A lot of my civilian clans are focused on common interests. There’s one down in the City where every member is a father, protecting their families!",
    "80C13D84": "Let's you and me talk.",
    "80C13D86": "Chit chat. You and me.",
    "80C13D88": "Let's do the thing.",
    "80C13D8A": "Hey there Guardian. What's up?",
    "80C13D8C": "Hey hey hey.",
    "80C13D8E": "Just ignore the bird, talk to me.",
    "80C13D90": "And what would you like to say?",
    "80C13D92": "Did you need something?",
    "80C13D94": "Where'd you go?",
    "80C13D96": "Keep it together, girl. ",
    "80C13D97": "We're all the same, deep down, we all want the same things. Guardian, Ghost, Human, Exo, Awoken  Frame. Bird? ",
    "80C13D99": "Deep breaths, Suraya. The chance there are any bears up here is very small.",
    "80C13D9B": "These people are friends. Friends, Suraya.",
    "80C13D9D": "If I'd known I was going to be working with this many Guardians, I would probably have listened at school more.",
    "80C13D9F": "Gotta get Devrim back to the City for a visit. I mean, if nothing else I need some pie.",
    "80C13DA1": "Was he looking at you funny? I think he was looking at you funny because you're a bird.",
    "80C13DA3": "Hey, bird. Be careful. I swear, if you get sucked into a jet turbine I'm gonna be so mad.",
    "80C13DA5": "Stick close, buddy. We don't want some trigger happy Guardian looking at you over some sights.",
    "80C13DAA": "You're doing great out there, Devrim. Thank you for everything.",
    "80C13DAC": "That sounds great, Amanda. Then we can  sorry, how many rounds? Is that a tradition, or did you just pick a number?",
    "80C13DB0": "I appreciate what you're saying Ikora. Thank you. Yes, we'll speak again tomorrow.",
    "80C13DB2": "A Clan is just a family you choose to join. ",
    "80C13E00": "Talk to me.",
    "80C13E02": "I'm here.",
    "80C13F25": "Say what you wanna say.",
    "80C13F27": "Did you wanna talk to me?",
    "80C13F29": "Did you have some clan stuff to talk about?",
    "80C13F2B": "Are you still with us?",
    "80C13F2D": "Heya!",
    "80C13F2F": "Yup yup.",
    "80C13F31": "Mmm hmm?",
    "80C13F33": "Hi!",
    "80C13F35": "Hey there.",
    "80C13F37": "Yyyyyyyyes?",
    "80C2A05D": "Whattya need?",
    "80C2A061": "What can I do for you?",
    "80C2A063": "And what can I do for you?",
    "80C2A065": "Guardian! Hello!",
    "80C2A06E": "Hey! How's the clan going?",
    "80C2A070": "Been hearing a lot of chatter about your clan!",
    "80C2A072": "Clan going okay? Everybody happy?",
    "80C2A074": "Hey hey! How's the clan going?",
    "80C2A076": "You going to hang out with your clan today?",
    "80C2A078": "Tell your clanmates I said hi!",
    "80C2A07A": "Got a banner for you here. Wear it with pride.",
    "80C2A07C": "Symbols inspire people. That's why clans fly their banners!",
    "80C2A07E": "Grab a banner and get inspired, Guardian!",
    "80C2A080": "Gotta meet with Banshee, get supplies from the Cryptarch, need tech support from Holliday  it's nice to have friends.",
    "80C2A082": "If we'd had Clans in the City when I was a kid  I might never have left.",
    "80C2A084": "Clan cookouts. We could get the Vanguard to sponsor, and  no.",
    "80C2A086": "The view up here's pretty good too, I guess. Pff. If you like concrete.",
    "80C2A088": "Man, if I thought there was a lot of people at the Farm ",
    "80C2A08A": "Are you judging me for selling out and moving back to the City? You're judging me. Pff. Birds.",
    "80C2A08C": "Did the bird distract you? He does that.",
    "80C2A091": "Wear it into battle. Let em' see you coming!",
    "80C2A093": "The only symbol you need is your clan banner.",
    "80C2A095": "May it bring you glory, and honor, and all that other stuff too!",
    "80C2A527": "The banner is yours! Now get out there and change the world!",
    "80C2A567": "Hope it's something good!",
    "80C2A7C1": "This is from the people. You earned it.",
    "80C2AB02": "Oh man I hope it's great!",
    "80C2AB05": "Your clan has done some real good out there!",
    "80C2AB07": "Lemme know what you get!",
    "80C2AB09": "I hear it on the streets, Guardian. Your clan is making a difference.",
    "80C2AB0B": "You're making a change out there. You and your clan.",
    "80C2AB0D": "Think of your clan when you use it!",
    "80C2AB0F": "Your clan has what it takes. Keep it up!",
    "80C2AB11": "Remember, your clan earned this!",
    "80C2AB13": "I think that's a good one.",
    "80C2AB1D": "Wish I'd had that years ago.",
    "80C2AB1F": "Oh, oh! Nice choice!",
    "80C2AB21": "Good call with that one.",
    "80C2AB23": "Couldn't have picked better myself.",
    "80C2AB35": "That's gonna work great for you, I can tell.",
    "80C2AB3B": "Get out there and put it to the test.",
    "80C2AB3D": "Why not? I think  yeah, good pick.",
    "80C2AB3F": "Gonna try it on for  oh, no. Just buying it. Okay.",
    "80C2AB41": "Tough enough even for you!",
    "80C2AB43": "Ohhhh man. I've had my eye on that.",
    "80C2AB45": "I  I'll be honest I didn't even know we had that.",
    "80C2AB47": "That's a rare find! Let me know how it works.",
    "80C2AB49": "Big spender, huh? Nice.",
    "80C2AB4B": "Yes! Oh, that's a great pick. You'll love it.",
    "80C2AB4D": "Be careful out there.",
    "80C2AB4F": "Take care of yourself, okay?",

    "80C8D0A9": "It's not like it was erased—his brain is structured to work like ours. It's more like it was suppressed. ",
    "80C8D0B4": "Now, some may think that mere mortals shouldn't be poking around at suppressed Warmind memories.",

    "80C8D0C0": "I programmed Rasputin's linguistic AI. I taught him his first words, and then he made his own. That is an answer. And that is a gift. Thank you.",

    "80C8D0C5": "I don't want to work on things alone anymore, if it can be helped. So I was wondering if you'd maybe help me finish it.",
    "80C8D0D5": "Are you familiar with the phrase 'Be careful what you wish for'?",
    "80C8D0D6": "Yeah. It's something that's been running through my head since watching Rasputin launch a brand new Warsat network under his sole control.",

    "80C8D25C": "Get this: a while back this punk stole something important to me.",
    "80C8D25D": "Thing is, he's like us—ever-living till you get his Ghost. But seeing as I ain't laid eyes on him in something like forever, guessing his Ghost probably got got.",
    "80C8D265": "So do me a favor and, uh, go see if that punk has what's mine, huh? I'd do it myself, but as you can see, I'm a busy man.",

    "80C8D268": "I finally have an answer for the man with the Golden Gun. And it's something you and me built together. What do you say we call it Malfeasance?",
    "80C8D271": "Sure, I shot bigger guns. But this thing is weaponized heat death pure atrophy. And it's the key to my freedom from HIM.",
    "80C8D276": "Fact is, you don't outdraw that Gunslinger. No one can. But my entire crew—armed with THIS? We don't have to outdraw him. We just have to get our shots in. He dies, too.",
    "80C8D278": "And make no mistake. You're part of my crew now.",
    "80C8D27D": "The man with the Golden Gun killed Callum. Every one o' those Hunter types has got a Golden Gun, but that man fights like it's HIS. He's been after me and my crew a long time.",

    "80C8D281": "Anyway, I gotta thank you. Not a lotta people I like. Even less I can trust.",
    "80C8D28A": "Just don't ever tell anyone what you saw today. You cross me and, well let's just say it wasn't an accident that man found Callum.",
    "80C8D291": "Let's get you back to action. There's plenty o' Gambit in front o' you.",
    "80C8D2CA": "Nice to meet you. I'm the official Mugunghwa Legion Merchant.",

    "80C8D652": "Ever since I got here, I've had the same dream. A field of flowers: sharp thorns, black petals, roots twisted with rot. ",
    "80C8D661": "A flock of silver birds with blue talons stoop to pluck the flowers. But the flowers always grow back. ",
    "80C8D662": "I don't know why, but the dream terrifies me.",

    "80C8D677": "The flowers always grow back. ",
    "80C8D67D": "All I ever wanted was to fight for the Queen. ",
    "80C8D682": "It all seemed so clear in my head. ",
    "80C8D6F0": "We killed Riven—then the Dreaming City was infected. We stopped the infection, and yet ",

    "80C8D708": "The flowers will always grow back. This is a war without end. ",
    "80C8D70B": "The lines are clear. The enemies within our sights. The means to fight them within our grasp.",
    "80C8D7C5": "So I will take on this curse. And I will fight it. Gladly. ",
    "80C8D7C6": "Now. What are we standing around for? We have fieldwork to do!",
    "80C8D7C7": "I had the dream again last night. And I now know why it terrifies me.  ",
    "80C8D7C9": "At first, I didn't know if I was the birds or the flowers.",
    "80C8D7CB": "And then I realized I'm both. All of the Awoken are both. The Dreaming City reflects this truth.",
    "80C8D7CD": "Don't you see? The Scorn move on the monastery once more; the gateway is open once more!",
    "80C8D7CF": "The flowers must be culled.",

    "80C8D9F2": "Eyes open, my friend. We've seen all of this before, but there's still plenty to learn.",
    "80C8D9FA": "It's an honor to fight for my people. And, of course, an honor to celebrate your victory, Planewalker. Well done, as always.",
    "80C8DA06": "I said once before that the curse denies us true victory—that was wrong. We win every time we rise to fight back. We will not be exhausted.",
    "80C8DA09": "Well done, my friend. Celebrate, and get ready to fight again.",
    "80C8DA0C": "The blights have faded, but the curse will rise again. We will be ready.",
    "80C8DA0E": "Revel in your victory, Guardian. If I could name you as another Queen's Wrath beside me, I would.",
    "80C8DA13": "The gateway is open. We'll strike again at the immortal heart of this curse.",
    "80C8DA18": "The gateway is open once more. [pause] I know it feels like we're fighting the tide. Thank you for continuing to fight.",
    "80C8DA1B": "The curse is always the same, yes. But every time it begins again, we are a little different.",
    "80C8DA20": "The gateway is open. I wish I could go with you, my friend.",
    "80C8DA22": "Hope springs eternal. Maybe this time, we will break the curse for good.",
    "80C8DA24": "The Well is charged. The gateway is open. The time is now.",
    "80C8DA26": "Soon we will find our way to the heart of this infection, and we will purge it at its source.",
    "80C8DA28": "The Awoken are with you.",
    "80C8DA2A": "I am with you.",
    "80C8DA5C": "As we prepare for the final assault, I've received some concerning intel from a Corsair on the front. ",
    "80C8DA6D": "I need your eyes on this. We can't afford any surprises. Not when we're this close.",
    "80C8DA7D": "The Dreaming City is safe. ",
    "80C8DA85": "The Queen is just a few steps away. ",
    "80C8DAA2": "My people have hope again. And the corruption that drove the prince to madness will never harm anyone else.",
    "80C8DAA3": "We have you to thank for all of it. ",
    "80C8DAA4": "Celebrate, hero. You deserve it. ",
    "80C8DAA6": "The Awoken will never forget you. ",
    "80C8DAA7": "Nor will I.",
    "80C8DAA8": "I should have never come here.",
    "80C8DAAA": "Everything I touch, I destroy.",
    "80C8DAAC": "And Mara claims to believe in me, but",
    "80C8DAAE": "No. One foot in front of the other.",
    "80C8DAB0": "I've got a fresh snap on the network. One of my Corsairs is injured.",
    "80C8DAB2": "Will you help me again? While you set up the evac, I'll consult with the Techeuns. ",
    "80C8DAB4": "The City hides so many secrets. There must be something here that can help us.",
    "80C8DC9F": "We've found the source of the corruption. ",
    "80C8DE6A": "Everything is seeping out of a stargate in the Confluence.",
    "80C8E2C3": "The Blind Well is the key to that stargate. ",
    "80C8E2C5": "The Well needs more time to charge, but soon",
    "80C8E2C7": "We will be able to strike directly at the heart of the curse.",
    "80C8EA44": "Until then, we must hold the line.",
    "80C8EA46": "If you're in search of another 'noble deed,' one of the Techeuns has fresh news.",
    "80C8EA48": "I knew she was alive. No one else believed it, but I did. And yet, I still I'm relieved.",
    "80C8EE25": "The fight isn't over—I sent an encrypted snap across Reef channels. The last of the Corsairs have answered the call!",
    "80C8EE28": "The Queen commands us to slay a beast at the heart of the Dreaming City. Nothing would make me happier than fighting for her",
    "80C8EE43": "Except if you were there fighting by my side.",
    "80C8F0A2": "It won't be easy. This is the beast that drove the prince to madness.",
    "80C8F0A3": "Trust me—if you hear voices in your head don't listen.",
    "80C8F478": "I'm sorry about Cayde. He didn't deserve to [sigh]",
    "80C8F47C": "And my people are in ruins. Those who knelt to Uldren, he slaughtered. The rest have scattered.",
    "80C8F47E": "But it's not too late for revenge. Here. This bow is for you, straight from the Vestian armory.",
    "80C8F480": "Let's go set things right.",
    "80C8F482": "The Spider gave us a chance to kill them all. One fell swoop. ",
    "80C8F484": "And if Uldren's there too even better. ",
    "80C8F486": "The traitor prince will not survive us.",
    "80C8F488": "Cayde's killers are still out there, but the hunt is not over.",
    "80C8F48A": "You take down the Barons. Thin the herd. As for Uldren",
    "80C8F48C": "Did you see that Awoken spire when you landed here? It's called the Watchtower.",
    "80C8F48E": "I shouldn't be telling you this, but my people's greatest secrets lie beyond that spire. ",
    "80C8F490": "There's no other reason Uldren would come to the Tangled Shore.",
    "80C8F492": "Sooner or later, he WILL go to the Watchtower. We must stop him BEFORE that happens.",
    "80C8F494": "Good hunting.",
    "80C8F495": "After the war, everyone in the Reef mourned our Queen and our prince.",
    "80C8F496": "Except me. I didn't believe they had died. I couldn't.",
    "80C8F497": "But then Uldren returned. He told me he could hear the Queen's voice in his head.",
    "80C8F499": "That's when I knew he was changed. I could have prevented all of this. But instead, I hid him away in the Prison of Elders. And now ",
    "80C8F49B": "Cayde is dead. The Reef is in ruins. And I've confirmed that Uldren is on his way to the Watchtower.",
    "80C8F49D": "It's now or never.",
    "80C8F49F": "The deed is done. But I can't rest. ",
    "80C8F4A0": "I want answers.",
    "80C8F4A2": "I want to know how to protect my people from whatever horrors infect the other side of that gateway.",
    "80C8F4A4": "And the prince must be laid to rest.",
    "80C8F4A6": "I'm going through the Watchtower to the Dreaming City.",
    "80C8F4A8": "Take this talisman. It will grant you safe passage.",
    "80C8F4AA": "Follow me when you can. There's no one else I'd rather have watching my back. And if anyone deserves answers it's you. ",
    "80C8F4EA": "Welcome back, dear friend! Your bloody quest for revenge was a boon for us both. Bye-bye, Barons. Adieu, Awoken. Only Spider remains.",
    "80C8F4EE": "I see the Queen-less Queen's Wrath left you with a broken trinket. Typical.",
    "80C8F4F0": "Offer the treasures of the Awoken but conveniently fail to give you the means of claiming them.",
    "80C8F4F2": "Lucky for you, Spider is a very near and dear friend of yours Hahahaha",
    "80C8F4F4": "Welcome back, dear friend! Your bloody quest for revenge was a boon for us both. Bye-bye, Barons. Adieu, Awoken. Only Spider remains.",
    "80C8F4F6": "However the Prison of Elders is still leaking like a sieve.",
    "80C8F4F8": "A true friend would find that as loathsome a problem as I do. And are we not trusted allies? [menacing laughter]",
    "80C8F4FA": "Huh. Well? Ready for fortune and glory in the Watchtower? Well, go on. I won't stop you.",
    "80C8F4FC": "See, I had a quid pro quo with Queen Mara Sov. Nobody in or out on my watch. But now?",
    "80C8F4FE": "Taken pour out, Scorn flow in—place is a revolving door, and I'm washing my hands of it.",
    "80C8F500": "So, you see our Awoken friends, you tell them I met the parameters of my commitment 100%.",
    "80C8F502": "Bon voyage, friend. Oh, and the next time you get the itch to play on the right side of wrong, you know where to find me.",
    "80C8F504": "Now we are friends. And I take friendship seriously. [chuckle] Very seriously.",
    "80C8F506": "Oh, now don't look at me like that. I would never ask you to do something that wasn't in your own interest, too.",
    "80C8F508": "Remember that.",
    "80C8F50A": "So. To business. I will supply you with the Barons' location—with which I am quite familiar, as it was, until recently MINE.",
    "80C8F50C": "So—even the great 'hero of the Red War' has limits.",
    "80C8F50E": "Eight Barons and an Awoken prince—and only one of you. I so dislike betting on the underdog",
    "80C8F510": "But you are resourceful ",
    "80C8F512": "And you do have the Queenless Queen's Wrath in your corner.",
    "80C8F514": "Ah, you've talked me into it. Our friendship shall continue. Pursue your vengeance.",
    "80C8F516": "When the Shore is a bit less crowded, we will speak again of favors.",
    "80C8F518": "Look at you. If our prodigal prince is not yet afraid of you ",
    "80C8F51A": "He should be.",
    "80C8F51C": "Six down yet the strongest three remain. Of the prince and his pet Fanatic, reports are few.",
    "80C8F51E": "However, your bloodbath has forced the Machinist out of hiding.",
    "80C8F520": "Moreover, I hear she's amassing great quantities of corrupted Ether—to grow the Fanatic's depraved armies. ",
    "80C8F522": "When you pay the Machinist a visit, I urge you to destroy any and all caches of their vile ambrosia.",
    "80C8F524": "And by the way?",
    "80C8F526": "Death suits you.",
    "80C8F528": "So that royal runt Uldren wants into the Watchtower.",
    "80C8F52A": "I always wondered what secrets and treasures the Awoken stashed in that ersatz spire. But my friendship with Queen Mara, while she lived, stayed my hand.",
    "80C8F52C": "Well, that and a locked door. ",
    "80C8F52E": "Thus I am honor-bound to send a selection of my finest to help you find that ever-elusive closure.",
    "80C8F530": "I must say I cannot wait to see how this ends.",
    "80C8F532": "One more thing before I give you the location of the Barons' soiree.",
    "80C8F534": "The Prison of Elders continues to leak like a sieve. SOMEONE should clean up that mess before traipsing off for murder and mayhem.",
    "80C8F536": "What do you say, 'friend'? Quid pro quo before you go?",
    "80C8F662": "You did it! You won the Crucible contest!",
    "80C8F666": "Now, I asked the folks at Tex Mechanica if I could give you your prize myself. ",
    "80C8F668": "So here it is. Shotgun by the name of: The Chaperone.",
    "80C8F66A": "Treat her right and she'll treat you right. ",
    "80C8F66C": "Did Petra Venj pull the trigger, or was it you?",
    "80C8F66E": "Wait. Wait, don't tell me. I—I don't want to know.",
    "80C8F670": "Either way, wasn't gonna bring Cayde back.",
    "80C8F672": "I'm just glad you're safe.",
    "80C8F674": "Anyway. You here for a refit? How can I help you?",
    "80C8F676": "Good news for ya, Guardian!",
    "80C8F678": "The Tex Mechanica weapons foundry is sponsoring a Crucible tournament. ",
    "80C8F67A": "Reward is: The Chaperone. Reprised and refitted. ",
    "80C8F67C": "I'm helpin' 'em with the contest, seeing as how the Chaperone's based on my ma's old gun.",
    "80C8F67E": "I hope you win!",
    "80C8F680": "I was born outside the City walls, you know that?",
    "80C8F682": "Yeah, it was rough on the refugee roads. My ma died crossing the Panama Ravine. ",
    "80C8F684": "Pa died just a half-day's ride from the City gate.",
    "80C8F686": "Folks back then thought, if you made it to the City, you were safe. ",
    "80C8F688": "Took me a long time to feel safe here.",
    "80C8F68A": "I guess that's why I like working in the Tower with y'all. Guardians don't die. ",
    "80C8F68C": "'Least, that's what I thought. But",
    "80C8F68E": "Forward momentum, buddy. ",
    "80C8F690": "That's what Cayde would want. ",
    "80C8F692": "And, uh what else can we do?",
    "80C8F699": "As long as the Traveler hangs above us, creatures hungry for its Light will find us.",
    "80C8F69C": "This place is but a temporary refuge. Earth is dying. If humanity is to survive the dangers to come, we must leave this broken shell behind.",
    "80C8F69D": "Our future lies among the stars. Come with us, Guardian. Support Dead Orbit. Help us impress the Consensus, refit our ships, and save us all.",
    "80C8F69E": "Have you accepted the truth of Dead Orbit? Better late than never.",
    "80C8F6A0": "You’ve come at a good time. Dead Orbit can be magnanimous in victory. See for yourself what we have to offer.",
    "80C8F6A1": "Look what your wisdom has brought us! Victory! Honor! It is about time the City recognized Dead Orbit for all we do.",
    "80C8F6A2": "The extra materials we have earned in this rally will speed up repairs on our ships.",
    "80C8F6A3": "Take this, and remember that Dead Orbit shared its gifts with you.",
    "80C8F6A6": "When I entered the Pyramidion, I was led astray by curiosity and self-interest. I now pay an expeditiously advancing price.",
    "80C8F6A9": "Comparable, regrettably, to how Cayde's pride accosted him in the depths of that atrocious prison.",
    "80C8F6AA": "As I understand it, retribution has had its claws in you.",
    "80C8F6AB": "Bear in mind, assistant, try as you might, there's no circumventing the price.",
    "80C8F6B3": "Memory ain't so good these days. But Cayde Never forget Cayde.",
    "80C8F6B7": "Hunter through and through. Left all his worldly possessions to whoever finally took him down. ",
    "80C8F6B9": "Don't know about you. But. Rather lose every last memory in my head than know that little prince holds Cayde's prized cannon: the Ace of Spades.",
    "80C8F6BB": "You gotta promise me.",
    "80C8F6BD": "Put Uldren in the ground.",
    "80C8F6BF": "And get the Ace of Spades back.",
    "80C8F6C1": "If anyone should have the Ace",
    "80C8F6C3": "S'you. ",
    "80C8F6C5": "You did it. Ace's yours now.",
    "80C8F6C7": "I'm glad. Cayde would be glad too. ",
    "80C8F6C9": "But Ace Ace is in rough shape. Ain't seen this kinda corrosion since since ",
    "80C8F6CB": "Can't remember. Anyhow",
    "80C8F6CD": "Cayde woulda kept spare parts in his own personal loot stashes. Yours too, now, by rights.",
    "80C8F6CF": "Track 'em down, bring me the parts. We'll get this piece purring again.",
    "80C8F6D1": "All parts in place. Ace of Spades is good as new, now. ",
    "80C8F6D3": "Take it. When you wield it, remember",
    "80C8F6D5": "Remember",
    "80C8F6D7": "…Now wait a minute",
    "80C8F6D9": " Hey have you seen Cayde around lately?",
    "80C8F6DE": "I've always held a morbid curiosity about how Guardians process death—the kind you don't return from.",
    "80C8F6E2": "Then I saw the faces of those mourning Cayde. The Farm practically came to a standstill.",
    "80C8F6E4": "The old boy charmed the pants off the place, and it showed.",
    "80C8F6E6": "Death binds us all together, whoever we are—Guardians and non-Guardians alike.",
    "80C8F6E8": "Now, what say we pour one out for our old friend, eh?",
    "80C8F6F3": "Welcome back! New Monarchy stands triumphant today thanks to the efforts of our valiant Guardians.",
    "80C8F6F7": "The City is showing us great favor. The name of New Monarchy is on every citizen’s lips. Even Zavala almost cracked a smile when it was time for him to congratulate us. Almost.",
    "80C8F6F8": "We like to reward our loyalists. Please take this, as thanks for all that you do for this City.",
    "80C8F6F9": "New Monarchy would have liked your support. But we all make our own choices.",
    "80C8F6FA": "That said, in the spirit of unity, we are opening our armory for a limited time to all Guardians. If you so desire, you may purchase an example of our superior weaponry.",
    "80C8F6FB": "Perhaps it will persuade you to join us next time.",
    "80C8F6FC": "New Monarchy believes a strong Earth is essential for a strong humanity. We will survive. Together. And we will not surrender our home to anyone.",
    "80C8F6FD": "New Monarchy mobilized more rescue and relief efforts during the Red War than the other factions combined.",
    "80C8F6FE": "With your support, we could do even more. What do you say?",
    "80C8FA45": "Now, rumor has it Ada-1 has grown somewhat tolerant of you Lightmongers. Quite the achievement.",
    "80C8FA49": "Don't celebrate just yet, friend. Ada-1's headache has become my own.",
    "80C8FA4B": "It appears the same Black Armory contraband you found has turned up on my Shore.",
    "80C8FA4D": "To think someone other than me would sell their merch around here without even introducing themselves",
    "80C8FA4E": "I'm wildly interested in getting to know my latest competition. Perhaps we should start by 'saying hello' to some of their associates.",
    "80C8FA50": "Something tells me I'll be hearing the sweet sound of skulls knocking together very soon.",
    "80C8FA51": "Siviks- 'lost to none.' My impudent brother. And the Black Armory's assailant.",
    "80C8FA52": "It seems even a stint in the Prison of Elders did little to help my brother understand the concept of consequences.",
    "80C8FA53": "A harsher lesson might be in order. And, friend? Don't hold back.",
    "80C8FA55": "You know me, friend. I'm a 'sensitive' soul. I take no pleasure in seeing members of my family in distress.",
    "80C8FA57": "Take, for example, my highly valued business associates—the Black Armory. Your 'assistance' might just be the pick-me-up they need.",
    "80C8FA59": "Their name never graced your ears, I know. Allow me to pull the vast curtain of 'things-Guardians-don't-know' back an inch.",
    "80C8FA5B": "This right here is a token of the Black Armory's appreciation. Without it, they won't 'appreciate' the presence of someone with your job description.",
    "80C8FA5C": "Tread carefully, friend. You won't find hospitality as warm as the Spider's behind their doors.",
    "80C8FA6F": "Happy Dawning, Guardian. I don't believe we've met. My name is Eva.",
    "80C8FA73": "Before the Red Legion struck, I made my home in the old Tower selling my wares to Guardians like you.",
    "80C8FA75": "But since then Well. It's been a long year for old Eva.",
    "80C8FA77": "I'm the one who brought the Dawning to Guardians many years ago now.",
    "80C8FA78": "It's only right that you and I work together to bring joy to the Tower once more.",
    "80C8FA79": "Here, take this. Baking is good for the soul. And we could all use a little good these days.",
    "80C8FA7A": "My friend, you don't know how good it is to see you again.",
    "80C8FA7C": "It seems that this place has moved on without me. That's the way of things, I suppose.",
    "80C8FA7D": "But I wasn't about to let another Dawning go by without old Eva.",
    "80C8FA7E": "Not after everything I've been through.",
    "80C8FA7F": "I may not have any shaders or emblems to offer, but there are other ways to bring joy to the Tower.",
    "80C8FA80": "Here, take this. Baking is good for the soul. And we could all use a little good these days.",
    "80C8FA81": "Making something with your hands is uniquely satisfying, don't you think?",
    "80C8FA83": "I did a lot of that in the last year. You might say it's what kept me going.",
    "80C8FA85": "You know who's the perfect soul for these? Zavala. He's been through a lot. I know he's in a dark place.",
    "80C8FA86": "But the Dawning is about our Light guiding us out of that darkness.",
    "80C8FA88": "A little gift-wrapping should do the trick. There.",
    "80C8FA89": "Now, go give him your gift.",
    "80C8FA8B": "Well, what did he say?",
    "80C8FA8D": "Despite all he's been through, I'd like to think that Zavala appreciated your gift.",
    "80C8FA8F": "He's in a dark place. But the Dawning is about our Light guiding us out of that darkness.",
    "80C8FA90": "You know, I bet there are all kinds of other recipes you can discover out in the world. You Guardians always were good at experimenting.",
    "80C8FA92": "Here, take this book.",
    "80C8FA93": "If there's anyone I trust to spread more holiday cheer, it's you, my friend. Happy Dawning!",
    "80C8FAA0": "Welcome to the Revelry, my friend.",
    "80C8FAA4": "In the City, spring is a time for ordinary people to celebrate the simple fact that we are alive.",
    "80C8FAA6": "However dark the night may grow, we are still here! Still standing.",
    "80C8FAA8": "I want to share this tradition with the Tower. You Guardians must never forget the power of joy.",
    "80C8FAAA": "So, please! Revel! Revel in being alive! Break some rules. And most of all",
    "80C8FAAC": "Have fun. Happiness is fleeting. We must cherish it where we can find it.",
    "80C8FAAE": "Ah, you look a little sad. The Revelry is ending, is that it?",
    "80C8FAB0": "Next week, everything will go back to normal. Rules! Order! Calm! [laughs]",
    "80C8FAB2": "It is always a little disappointing when a good party ends, but that disappointment means you enjoyed yourself.",
    "80C8FAB4": "And that enjoyment, that's what really matters. We have had a very fine Revelry.",
    "80C8FAB6": "Next year, we will have another—bigger and crazier than the last.",
    "80C8FAB8": "Hold your good memories and keep your eyes on the future, my friend. That's all we can do.",
    "80C8FAC7": "So, how did it feel to celebrate your triumphs?",
    "80C8FACB": "I hope you took time to bask in every one of those moments.",
    "80C8FACD": "Each victory represents a time when your heroism kept us safe.",
    "80C8FACF": "Without you, there wouldn't be a Last City to come back to. For that, we are eternally grateful.",
    "80C8FAD1": "So please, friend, continue to embrace glory as much as you'd like. It's our gift to you.",
    "80C8FAD3": "Hello again! I've been hearing about all you've done for the City. People are talking!",
    "80C8FAD5": "We've all lost so much since the Red War. But we can't let that stop us from celebrating what we have—and the Guardians who keep us safe. ",
    "80C8FAD7": "I talked to Ikora, and this year we have something special.",
    "80C8FAD9": "A way to honor ALL the inspiring stories you've given the world.",
    "80C8FADB": "Go now, relive your glory. And friend? Have a happy Solstice.",
    "80C8FB07": "Dare I go against our values and ask a Guardian to craft a new Black Armory weapon?",
    "80C8FB0B": "If I do, our operations could finally restart",
    "80C8FB0C": "…but more of their kind would come.",
    "80C8FB0E": "They'll want our wares, of course. We'll need more supplies to meet demand, which means",
    "80C8FB0F": "…even more Guardians, which means further disgracing the memory of our founder.",
    "80C8FB10": "You've put me in quite the predicament.",
    "80C8FB11": "Our wares seduce you, Guardian.",
    "80C8FB13": "However, none can currently be sold.",
    "80C8FB14": "The Red War left us without a vital necessity, our Forge. In its absence, our operation has all but ceased.",
    "80C8FB15": "We have found no success in locating it, despite our best efforts.",
    "80C8FB16": "If you truly covet our wares, then understand: We would very much like our Forge back.",
    "80C8FB17": "And Guardian if you would return empty-handed, you'd best not return at all.",
    "80C8FB53": "Nice job, Guardian! You found another forge, took down the Fallen, and saved the day!",
    "80C8FB57": "Is that what you hoped to hear? Sorry to disappoint, but I am not your precious Vanguard.",
    "80C8FB59": "That was rude of me.",
    "80C8FB5A": "I just never intended on playing fetch with Guardians. And now this Siviks attempts to steal what we hold dear.",
    "80C8FB5B": "I eagerly anticipate the day we return the favor.",
    "80C8FB5D": "This is definitely forge-made. Though the serial number is unfamiliar. Doesn't match the forge in the European Dead Zone. And somehow—",
    "80C8FB5E": "'allen tech is baked in. Disgusting.",
    "80C8FB5F": "This abomination deserves to be broken, burned, and dumped into the void.",
    "80C8FB60": "Someone must have found another forge.",
    "80C8FB62": "Acquire any more of these abominations, and take them to our portly friend on the Tangled Shore.",
    "80C8FB63": "When you trust the Spider, what's lost becomes found.",
    "80C8FB76": "All things fade sooner or later, Guardian.",
    "80C8FB7A": "Don't mistake me being cryptic for disappointment—I am thrilled that we have obtained yet another forge. It's just",
    "80C8FB7B": "Before you came along, I believed the Black Armory's end was close at hand.",
    "80C8FB7D": "But as with our forges, you've reignited something inside me—a flame that had long been extinguished.",
    "80C8FB7F": "The Black Armory's future once again burns bright, thanks to you. And for that I am grateful.",
    "80C8FB80": "Look at you. Look at what you've done. What you've created. The first Black Armory weapon crafted by a Guardian.",
    "80C8FB82": "Oh, Ada. Ada, Ada, Ada. This predicament of a relationship has proven unexpectedly beneficial.",
    "80C8FB84": "Perhaps when we first met, I was a bit cold. Allow me to start over.",
    "80C8FB86": "Welcome to the Black Armory.",
    "80C8FB88": "Something's still missing",
    "80C8FB89": "There is one thing that comes to mind. Tough to come by. But then again, that's the kind of thing you're built for.",
    "80C8FB8B": "So you discovered the Exodus Black carried not one, but two forges",
    "80C8FB8D": "Yet another forge means more vessels, new weapons to craft, and—",
    "80C8FB8E": "Wait—that isn't a vessel. That's the forge's igniter. How did you and it's broken?",
    "80C8FB8F": "[sigh] The forge is useless until the igniter is repaired and reattached.",
    "80C8FB90": "Until then, consider my enthusiasm curbed.",
    "80C8FBA2": "Sidviks, perished. Another forge, recovered. And yet, one final piece of the puzzle remains",
    "80C8FBA5": "What was Siviks searching for in that facility? What secrets remain within the Black Armory Papers?",
    "80C8FBA7": "I pored through its pages, and I believe I found us a lead.",
    "80C8FBA9": "The artifact you forged—it's for the very weapon I used to avenge our murdered founder.",
    "80C8FBAA": "The pages imply that when the two are combined, they act as a key.",
    "80C8FBAC": "And I'd be honored if you used it to solve our final mystery.",
    "80C8FBAE": "Nothing about the Black Armory has escaped me over the years. ",
    "80C8FBAF": "Or so I thought, until Guardians unearthed a secret facility of ours, lost to us since the Golden Age.",
    "80C8FBB1": "The Black Armory Papers mention it in vague detail. Something about a 'Project Niobe.' But nothing more.",
    "80C8FBB3": "Without the missing pages, the puzzle remains incomplete.",
    "80C8FBB4": "In their absence, the best course of action would be to simply scour the place itself.",
    "80C8FBB6": "This decryption device it's for our founder's journals! I've used it to decode several of our recovered pages.",
    "80C8FBB8": "It would appear that Project Niobe's purpose was to develop and produce enhanced prototypes.",
    "80C8FBBA": "There are even sketchings. They appear to be some sort of advanced weapon.",
    "80C8FBBB": "One of the pages provides instructions for a vessel! Perhaps we should start there.",
    "80C8FBBC": "It's time we discover for ourselves what Siviks is after.",
    "80C8FBE3": "There are not enough gifts from the Black Armory to show my appreciation. But know: you are always welcome here.",
    "80C8FBE7": "Her name was Henriette. She was our founder. And my mother. All along, one and the same. I can't believe I never knew.",
    "80C8FBE9": "The last page was a letter. Written to me. To me. Her death was self-sacrifice. To save me.",
    "80C8FBEA": "I will not waste this second chance at life. ",
    "80C8FBEB": "But she is only one of two reasons I stand here today. You are the other.",
    "80C8FBEC": "There are not enough gifts from the Black Armory to show my appreciation. But know: you are always welcome here.",
    "80C8FBF5": "Hey. What the hell are you doin' with that gun? That's the Last Word!",
    "80C8FBF9": "[chuckles] You know you can trust me. But the man who gave you that? He's the one who walked into hell and spread my friend's ashes on the side of a rock.",
    "80C8FBFA": "You",
    "80C8FBFB": "You are such a punk. Trying to play both of us, huh? You are insane. I dig it.",
    "80C8FBFD": "But ask yourself: What's to stop that man from doing you in like he's done with so many of my friends?",
    "80C8FBFE": "I'll be seein' you. Punk.",
    "80C8FC14": "Listen, hotshot. I've told you more about me than I tell most people. Trust.",
    "80C8FC18": "You know about that rat bastard Shin. You know about the Shadows.",
    "80C8FC1A": "And you know how life's not about Light and Dark—it's about survival.",
    "80C8FC1C": "You gotta reckon with yourself, now.",
    "80C8FC1E": "When fate comes a'calling, will you give in and abide by the Traveler's dogma? Will you beg the deep black for mercy?",
    "80C8FC20": "Or will you drift?",
    "80C8FC22": "Well, look at you. You been collectin' names. Buildin' a reputation.",
    "80C8FC24": "Your legend keeps growin'. The Nine. The Shadows of Yor. Shin Malphur.",
    "80C8FC26": "I keep tabs, and they're all talkin' 'bout you.",
    "80C8FC28": "Everything you touch changes. And some folks hate change.",
    "80C8FC2A": "You watch your back. Reckoner.",
    "80C8FC2C": "Hey—hey, that's a Thorn you're wearin', you nutjob!",
    "80C8FC2E": "I like you, kid. But wearing that gun is making a statement. To the Vanguard. To the Shadows of Yor.",
    "80C8FC30": "One side sees sacrilege. The other side sees well, sacrilege. In their eyes, you ain't earned that gun.",
    "80C8FC32": "I used to wear one, too. Hundred reasons I don't anymore. You watch your back.",
    "80C8FC34": "I know you all fancy yourselves gun collectors. But this is a little nuts.",
    "80C8FC36": "You got yourself the Last Word. The Golden Gun of the Man himself.",
    "80C8FC38": "You got yourself a Thorn. The Vanguard will watch you. The Shadows will hunt you.",
    "80C8FC3A": "Those guns are cursed. Fire a single bullet from either one, and you better make sure it's a kill.",
    "80C8FC3C": "Or it may just be the end of you.",
    "80C8FC49": "I told you not to look into the Emissary and you did it anyway. You know how many people I killed for less?",
    "80C8FC4D": "Shut up. Don't answer that. I don't need the sass right now.",
    "80C8FC4F": "I'm in over my head, kid. Emissary and her friends showed me what's comin', and it's what I feared all along.",
    "80C8FC51": "Put aside your dogma. The fight that's coming can't be won with Light alone. ",
    "80C8FC53": "Gambit's your salvation and mine. See you on the field.",
    "80C8FC55": "Hold up. You SAW that damn card game? Nah, nah, nah. Not good. They're givin' you visions, too.",
    "80C8FC57": "I'll say it straight—I got a bad habit of biting off more'n I can chew. But hey. Guy's gotta eat.",
    "80C8FC59": "And the deal that got me the Haul it just looked so damn tasty.",
    "80C8FC5B": "But damn. They're reaching out to you. No, sir. You keep clear of that little blue psycho.",
    "80C8FC5D": "Leave this to me. You see her again, you turn the other way, understand? Trust nothing you hear.",
    "80C8FC5F": "Hey. If I tell you what I know about the Emissary, will you promise to stop wasting your time on her?",
    "80C8FC61": "She used to be Reefborn. Loyal to the Queen. Then she died. Ghost picked her up. Took the name Orin.",
    "80C8FC63": "Then she went lookin' for the Nine. She needed power. She got it. But now she's somethin' else.",
    "80C8FC65": "She has no past to uncover. She's not what she was. Neither am I. So stop lookin' for her.",
    "80C8FC8A": "We understand each other a little better now, huh, kid? ",
    "80C8FC8E": "Just be careful. Seems everyone who knows me is either trying to kill me or [laughs] dead.",
    "80C8FC90": "Lotta people comin' for my Ghost. You're stickin' your neck out by gettin' so chummy with me.",
    "80C8FC92": "But hey. If that day comes? They'll eat bullets from both of us. Trust.",
    "80C8FC94": "Hahaha! You got grit, kid. I admire a man willing to risk the trust of everyone who's ever been kind to him.",
    "80C8FC96": "But lemme set the record straight—you're choosin' to walk with a monster. Monsters survive. Trust.",
    "80C8FC98": "People change. Priorities change. Stick with me, and you'll see that.",
    "80C8FC9A": "Now. As a symbol of our new partnership, I need a favor from ya. Got a shipment waiting in the Tangled Shore. Pick it up for me. I'll tell Spider you're comin'.",
    "80C8FC9C": "So there you have it, snitch. Not gonna hide what I've done, but I'm not braggin', either.",
    "80C8FC9E": "Just tryin' to stay alive the best way I know how.",
    "80C8FCA0": "You go tell your heroes. Hope they got the dirt they were lookin' for. Just know that there's too much at stake—you ain't stoppin' me.",
    "80C8FCA2": "Many have tried. They're, uh well, they're dead now.",
    "80C8FCA4": "You're pickin' the Vanguard over me, huh? [chuckles] You punk.",
    "80C8FCA6": "But every man's got to have a code, I get it. I got one, too.",
    "80C8FCA8": "Out of respect for principles (and a righteous fear of Ikora's big-ass shotgun) you do you, kid.",
    "80C8FCAA": "But. I'm gonna change your mind about me. Whoever, or whatever you think I am You're wrong. How's that suit ya? Snitch.",
    "80C8FCAC": "Hey, hey. Let's be straight with each other. I know the Vanguard's watching me.",
    "80C8FCAE": "Probably want you to snitch, am I right? [laughs] If you're considering, I get it.",
    "80C8FCB0": "Ol' Drifter likes to play both sides, too. But think about it.",
    "80C8FCB2": "You stand with them, you're a dead man walking. My games have pissed off a whole lotta dangerous people.",
    "80C8FCB4": "You stand with me, I got your back. Trust. So what'll it be?",
    "80C8FCB6": "You been my crew for a while, blood. Gambit. Prime. All the good work.",
    "80C8FCB8": "And against my better judgment I trust you. Just a little.",
    "80C8FCBA": "But if you're gonna keep hanging with ol' Drifter, there's some things you should know.",
    "80C8FCBC": "I've prepared a little survival guide for ya, from the ultimate prepper himself. Heh. That's me.",
    "80C8FCBE": "Step one? Get your ass to Europe.",
    "80C8FCC0": "What do you think of the new digs?",
    "80C8FCC2": "Eh, never mind. Shut up. I can't take sass right now. We've got work to do.",
    "80C8FCC4": "Gambit's been such a resounding success, I'm expanding my operation.",
    "80C8FCC6": "I'll need a Gambit regular like you to make this work. It'll be dangerous. Some day soon, we could all be dead.",
    "80C8FCC8": "But isn't risk half the fun? If you're in I'll see you soon. You psycho.",
    "80C8FCD7": "Well? Whadya think? Pretty good, right?",
    "80C8FCDB": "Gambit's my pride and joy, but Prime's a whole new song and dance.",
    "80C8FCDD": "If I did this right—and I think I did this right—you freaks will line up for this 'til the sun goes out.",
    "80C8FCDF": "What's this all for? [chuckles] Why don't you head on up to the Derelict for a behind-the-scenes tour?",
    "80C8FCE1": "Y'all helped me get Gambit going. And for that, I will be ever grateful.",
    "80C8FCE3": "But I've expanded my operation. I call this new scam Gambit Prime.",
    "80C8FCE5": "Consider it a down payment on a dream.",
    "80C8FCE7": "Give it a try, hotshot. You were my inspiration.",
    "80C8FCE9": "Hey—word around the Tower is that you snuck your way into a Cryptarch vault.",
    "80C8FCEB": "Took somethin' that wasn't yours.",
    "80C8FCED": "It's a strong move that the Vanguard won't like. If they find out. I dig it.",
    "80C8FCEF": "Hey, do me a solid. I'm a scavenger. Live a hard life.",
    "80C8FCF1": "If you make your way back into that vault—grab something for me, will ya?",
    "80C8FD1E": "This Chalice is my gift to you. It is a symbol of power for a Shadow of Calus.",
    "80C8FD22": "My Shadows are a chosen people, selected from the best of the best of each world I've encountered.",
    "80C8FD24": "Restore the Chalice so that you may fill it to the very brim with the viscera of your enemies.",
    "80C8FD26": "And do not forget to drink your fill. How else will you grow fat from strength?",
    "80C8FD28": "Two years ago, Dominus Ghaul had you.",
    "80C8FD2A": "The Light left you, told you all was lost. But you disagreed. And now here you are.",
    "80C8FD2C": "Your tenacity made you my favorite Earthling. So I built you a hall. A monument to your achievements.",
    "80C8FD2E": "You'll have to fill it yourself, of course. But I know how you like to collect. Doesn't matter what you have to kill. [laughs]",
    "80C8FD30": "I am here for maintena— [static]",
    "80C8FD32": "Ah. Finally found you. You're a busy Little Light.",
    "80C8FD34": "Do you recognize me? It's your beloved Emperor Calus.",
    "80C8FD36": "I've been watching you All your good work. I believe you're ready.",
    "80C8FD38": "It's time you and I met more intimately. I've sent a gift to Nessus for you.",
    "80C8FD3A": "I'll see you soon—o champion mine.",
    "80C8FD3C": "I was lost, once exiled from my people. Floating aimlessly amongst the stars.",
    "80C8FD3E": "But then I found it. Something breathtakingly glorious! The truth of the universe",
    "80C8FD40": "The Ascendant artifact you've returned to me is an echo of that truth.",
    "80C8FD42": "You and I will need it before the end comes.",
    "80C8FD44": "The future can't be fought.",
    "80C8FD46": "You've improved the Chalice. Your taste is impeccable. But it remains incomplete.",
    "80C8FD48": "If you wish to finish your Chalice, come to the Leviathan.",
    "80C8FD4A": "There is a dark place aboard my ship that you have never been. Where I was reborn. Like you were reborn.",
    "80C8FD4C": "The Menagerie awaits you, Guardian.",
    "80C8FD4E": "There are Hive aboard the Leviathan. They are mine, though they don't know it.",
    "80C8FD50": "One of my Loyalists controls them. He possesses an artifact of Ascendant authority.",
    "80C8FD52": "Unfortunately, wielding it has cost him his mind.",
    "80C8FD54": "If you two should meet, consider his welcome overstayed. And his riches yours for the taking.",
    "80C8FD56": "How I love to see you revel in triumph! ",
    "80C8FD58": "Your hall overflows with tributes, and in return, you grow fat from strength.",
    "80C8FD5A": "I think it's time you lit the way, Guardian.",
    "80C8FD5C": "Go. Ignite the spark that casts the Shadow of Earth. You've proven you can.",
    "80C8FD5E": "So you have the ear of the Queen's Wrath. No Reefborn Awoken has fallen to Shadow And yet there is Darkness where they dwell.",
    "80C8FD60": "Put in a good word for me. I’ve never been granted an audience with the Awoken Queen. ",
    "80C8FD62": "I would so love to meet what they hid behind their borders.",
    "80C8FD64": "O champion mine. [laughs]",
    "80C8FDC7": "The Hive are afraid. I can smell it.",
    "80C8FDCB": "The remains of Crota's court—those who escaped your strength and my vengeance—have sequestered themselves below the surface. ",
    "80C8FDCD": "Their chants echo across the Ascendant Plane and beyond it. ",
    "80C8FDCF": "To the realm from which the pyramids fly.  ",
    "80C8FDD1": "You must descend into the Moon's depths, ensure that such an alliance never comes to pass. ",
    "80C8FDD3": "Since last we spoke, your fireteam delved into the Moon's depths and disrupted their dark ritual.",
    "80C8FDD5": "But there is still much we do not know. On what powers did the Hive seek to call? What does it have to do with the Pyramid? ",
    "80C8FDD7": "And what do the dread queens Savathûn and Xivu Arath think of this new shade of Darkness? ",
    "80C8FDD9": "Stay vigilant. If my sight is true, the Hive will attempt this ritual again. ",
    "80C8FDDB": "You must be there to stop them. ",
    "80C8FDDD": "In the depths of the Hellmouth, my very soul was shattered into pieces.",
    "80C8FDDF": "It was all I could do to try and pick them up again. But some pieces, as you can see, required replacing.",
    "80C8FDE1": "I must call upon one of them now—an ancient Talisman imbued with the magic of the Hive.",
    "80C8FDE3": "Without it, the true power of the Nightmare Essence could not be harnessed.",
    "80C8FDE5": "Through their union, we take our first step toward unearthing the secrets of the Pyramid. But it is only a step.",
    "80C8FDE7": "Further Essences require further Hive magic, neither of which I possess.",
    "80C8FDE9": "Acquire both, and our path to the Pyramid should present itself.",
    "80C8FDEB": "Have you heard the call of the Deathsong? Do you remember its tune?",
    "80C8FDED": "Madness and decay and destruction of the flesh.",
    "80C8FDEF": "Its terrible melody can be ours.",
    "80C8FDF1": "The deadly chorus of the Deathsinger's call has been stolen and bound to your growing arsenal.",
    "80C8FDF3": "Once more you have proven yourself worthy to stand against the night.",
    "80C8FDF5": "Let the Deathsong protect you as it rends those who once cheered its wicked power.",
    "80C8FDF7": "Ghaul the Fanatic Crota. Like living nightmares, your past confronts you, Guardian.",
    "80C8FDF9": "Old scars reopen around me as well. Phantoms of my friends return with a malice they never truly had.",
    "80C8FDFB": "Every one of them, the twisted will of that looming Pyramid.",
    "80C8FDFD": "We must not let it distract us from our goal: finding a way inside.",
    "80C8FDFF": "Together, we have conquered our enemies. We will do it again.",
    "80C8FE01": "We're in this together now. Nothing can stop us.",
    "80C8FE03": "The Pyramid trembles under the weight of our progress. With every victory, we draw closer to conquering it.",
    "80C8FE05": "The spoils of Hashladûn's death are twofold.",
    "80C8FE07": "We now know what the Hidden Swarm have been using to shield themselves from the Nightmares—and where it lies.",
    "80C8FE09": "The Cryptoglyph. If ever there was a more powerful set of runes the Hive use to conjure their magics, I have yet to learn of it",
    "80C8FE0B": "Of course, to acquire it, we must delve into horrific depths.",
    "80C8FE0D": "Our Cryptoglyph lies at the bottom of the Hellmouth.",
    "80C8FE0F": "Sai Mota screams as she did the day Omnigul tore her apart and silenced her forever.",
    "80C8FE11": "Our fates nearly intertwined today when a Nightmare of Omnigul swept through camp.",
    "80C8FE13": "My survival was a gift, granted by the Essence you retrieved from the Crota Nightmare.",
    "80C8FE15": "Were we to truly harness the power of this Essence, it may provide aid in the fight against the Nightmares—and beyond, to the Pyramid itself.",
    "80C8FE17": "It knows we're coming. I can sense it. And we will have the upper hand.",
    "80C8FE19": "Of all the things that haunt me, hesitation is not among them.",
    "80C8FE1B": "Our world collapsed in pain and agony under the weight of these pyramids. What lies within? More of the same?",
    "80C8FE1D": "It doesn't matter. We must know.",
    "80C8FE1F": "The unknown can act as a siren that draws us in and swallows us whole.",
    "80C8FE21": "Please do not let yourself be consumed.",
    "80C8FE23": "I. Don't. Care. [grunts]",
    "80C8FE25": "You reek of the Hellmouth.",
    "80C8FE27": "That armor will prove useful in the battles to come—but the Pyramid demands greater power to enter it.",
    "80C8FE29": "Three further pieces of armor—three more Nightmares.",
    "80C8FE2B": "These diseases torture the Moon with their very presence.",
    "80C8FE2D": "Send them back to the past where they belong, and in return they shall provide us with power.",
    "80C8FE2F": "In the meantime, the Nightmares continue to plague parts of our galaxy, leaving only suffering in their wake.",
    "80C8FE31": "If we ignore them, they fester and spread. How long before they reach the Last City?",
    "80C8FE33": "How long before our friends become infected with this same torment? We will not let this come to pass.",
    "80C8FE35": "These Nightmares must be kept at bay. Whatever it takes.",
    "80C8FE37": "They are not our salvation They're our destruction.",
    "80C8FE39": "This has been a manipulation from the very start. They know we're here. They know what we've found.",
    "80C8FE3B": "The artifact you recovered may be tainted. After all, they wanted us to have it.",
    "80C8FE3D": "But a treasure such as this is far too valuable to destroy. I must stay and study it with the utmost care.",
    "80C8FE3F": "Whatever I discover, you will be the first to know.",
    "80C8FE41": "All this time, they've been closer than we even knew. First, the Pyramid on the Moon.",
    "80C8FE43": "Now, a team of Guardians finds remnants of their presence in the Black Garden.",
    "80C8FE45": "Upon this discovery, the artifact came to life. From it, we received another vile attempt at manipulation.",
    "80C8FE47": "They show us only what they want us to see. As if we're to act the part of puppets and nothing more.",
    "80C8FE49": "Any further communication they send, we must discard. The moment we let them turn our gaze from the truth is the moment we lose.",
    "80C8FE4B": "Our fates nearly intertwined today when a horrid Hive Nightmare swept through camp.",
    "80C8FEAE": "Hey, friend. Hell of a year, huh?",
    "80C8FEB2": "Lot of us still haven't gotten over the Red War.",
    "80C8FEB3": "But the Infinite Forest was saved, Rasputin came back things were just startin' to look up.",

    "80C8FEB7": "Well, I'll be damned if we're gonna sit around and mope all day.",
    "80C8FEB8": "He woulda hated that.",
    "80C8FEB9": "So let's have some fun, huh? I'll try to keep everyone's spirits up back here. You put this on.",
    "80C8FEBA": "Go show the bad guys they can't keep us down.",
    "80C8FEBB": "Welcome back. Ikora stopped by while you were in flight. She sure don't miss a thing.",
    "80C8FEBD": "She says there's somethin' up with the Infinite Forest. But our old buddy Osiris isn't pickin' up when we call.",
    "80C8FEBE": "I told her you were wearin' masks and gettin' into trouble on Io and she laughed!",
    "80C8FEC0": "Ikora! I couldn't believe it.",
    "80C8FEC1": "Guess the only thing to do now is what you been doin'. Put your mask back on, head to the Forest, and see what happens.",
    "80C8FEC2": "Oh, and our comms don't work in there, so you're on your own. Watch yourself, all right?",
    "80C8FEC4": "Ah! I know that look. That's the 'I saw somethin' real scary, but I'm a Guardian, so now it's dead' face. Mm-hmm.",
    "80C8FEC6": "Glad there's still someone like you keepin' an eye on things.",
    "80C8FEC7": "But if the Forest was that easy to shut down, you and Osiris woulda done it a while ago. So get back in there with your mask on if the mood strikes ya. See how far you can get.",
    "80C8FEC8": "And don't forget to have fun out there. [laugh] After all, it's a festival!",
    "80C8FECE": "Good to pay Old Russia a visit, huh? Lotta memories back there.",
    "80C8FED1": "I still think we're missin' somethin'. What were the Fallen really after? Why go after some Cryptarch from the Reef?",
    "80C8FED2": "Ah, well, that's above my pay grade. Meantime, you should probably have this. I found it in his stuff.",
    "80C8FED4": "One last trinket he don't need.",
    "80C8FED5": "And thanks, Guardian. Not everybody's lucky enough to get avenged.",
    "80C8FED7": "Still can't believe what they did to his robe. Treated it like a trophy.",
    "80C8FED8": "Even a puffed-up Cryptarch doesn't deserve to end up like that. Nobody does.",
    "80C8FED9": "I was out of ideas, so I showed Rahool what you found. His face when he found out like it had happened to him.",
    "80C8FEDB": "Couple hours later, I get some coordinates on my terminal—for a Fallen transmat pad in the EDZ. I can't read where it's pointin', but it's somewhere they don't want you to be.",
    "80C8FEDD": "This is our chance. Head back across the pond, use that transmat, and get ready for trouble.",
    "80C8FEDE": "Everybody's got their head in the clouds. Dreamin' City, Hive worm god, Warmind",
    "80C8FEDF": "It's easy to forget about the lives of regular people, even for well, for heroes like you.",
    "80C8FEE1": "Remember the Cryptarch in the Reef? I do. His name was Ives.",
    "80C8FEE2": "That's right: 'was.' He's dead. And not like all the other Awoken who died in the Reef. Petra says he was murdered.",
    "80C8FEE3": "She sent me all his stuff. Got her own problems out on the Shore, so this is up to us.",
    "80C8FEE4": "Cayde taught me a lotta nonsense. But he also taught me that you gotta follow a trail before it goes cold.",
    "80C8FEE5": "Keep an eye out for the pages that go in that thing. They're the only clues we're gonna get.",
    "80C8FEF0": "Guardian, thank you for coming.",
    "80C8FEF4": "Those things ",
    "80C8FEF6": "Our 'salvation.'",
    "80C8FEF8": "They drudge up our traumas, and for what? To distract us? Destroy us?",
    "80C8FEFA": "We've spent too much time looking backwards at tragedies beyond our control. Towards the collapse. The Red War. Cayde.",
    "80C8FEFC": "Enough.",
    "80C8FEFE": "Our enemy lays themselves bare out of ego. But they underestimate the strength of Guardians.",
    "80C8FF00": "They want a fight. We will give it to them.",
    "80C8FF02": "For most of us, there are moments where our losses creep into our minds and overwhelm our senses. ",
    "80C8FF04": "For Eris, that has been every second since those phantoms began haunting her.",
    "80C8FF06": "Sure, she's strong. Moreso than most. ",
    "80C8FF08": "But even the strongest require allies in their darkest moments. ",
    "80C8FF0A": "That's been you. Through it all, you stood by her side. As a friend.",
    "80C8FF0C": "That's something Eris hasn't had in a very long time.",
    "80C8FF0E": "She never forgot how you took down Crota. And she'll never forget this. Neither will I.",
    "80C8FF10": "I'm sure she won't soon forget it. And neither will I.",
    "80C8FF1D": "The Festival of the Lost will end next week.",
    "80C8FF21": "This is your last chance to collect masks and eat your fill of candy.",
    "80C8FF23": "Are you sick from all the sugar yet? [laughs]",
    "80C8FF25": "Maybe, maybe not! But make the most of this time while you have it.",
    "80C8FF27": "And if you have not visited Eris lately, perhaps you should pay her a visit.",
    "80C8FF29": "She has a special fondness for this holiday.",
    "80C8FF2B": "I did not understand the Festival of the Lost when I first returned to the Tower.",
    "80C8FF2D": "I had lost so much. My fireteam. My eyes. My Ghost.",
    "80C8FF2F": "So, to see people celebrating something so serious as loss with stupid masks, and stupid candy",
    "80C8FF31": "It was hard to understand. It felt like everyone in the Tower was mocking me and all my dead friends.",
    "80C8FF33": "It took a long time for me to see that sometimes the best way to honor the dead is to live your best life.",
    "80C8FF35": "And above all to brush your teeth. Dental hygiene is key to a long life.",
    "80C8FF37": "Trust me. I should know.",
    "80C8FF39": "Hello again! Lots has happened since we last met, hm?",
    "80C8FF3B": "An old friend came home. The Moon is infested again! And the Vex are invading, tsk-tsk-tsk.",
    "80C8FF3D": "These are all important things. But, as always, it is also very important to remember those who have left us.",
    "80C8FF3F": "And to look forward, with hope in our hearts. That is the purpose of this festival.",
    "80C8FF41": "A holiday about death and loss, yes, but also hidden identities. Beautiful lanterns. And candy!",
    "80C8FF43": "Have fun, my love.",
    "80C8FF45": "Hello, my friend. Happy Festival of the Lost.",
    "80C8FF47": "We're making good progress on this portal.",
    "80C8FF49": "Guardians like you have been contributing data, supplies, intel, you name it.",
    "80C8FF4B": "I can't remember the last time we all came together like this. The Red War, I suppose.",
    "80C8FF4D": "There's a saying that Osiris once taught me. 'We are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants.'",
    "80C8FF4F": "Every truth we discover, every victory we win is only possible because of those who came before us.",
    "80C8FF51": "Take time to rest and enjoy the Festival. You've been working hard.",
    "80C8FF5C": "I hear you survived the Cosmodrome. That's a tough place to start your new life, Guardian. I'm impressed.",
    "80C8FF60": "But there are many battles left to fight.",
    "80C8FF62": "Look around you. The Last City, its people this is our home. But this home is not safe.",
    "80C8FF64": "We must protect it. That is a Guardian's duty.",
    "80C8FF66": "We must take our fight beyond these walls—push back the forces that threaten our existence.",
    "80C8FF68": "To that end, I will help guide you as you explore the wider worlds of our lost frontier.",
    "80C8FF6A": "Adventure awaits, Guardian. I know you'll answer its call.",
    "80C8FF80": "Guardian! You're here. You've done so much, already. Now",
    "80C8FF84": "The Crucible of Lord Shaxx will prepare you.",
    "80C8FF86": "In my arena, should a Titan stand in your way, CRUSH HIM. ",
    "80C8FF88": "If a Hunter confronts you, BREAK HER BLADE. ",
    "80C8FF8A": "If a Warlock speaks, FEED HIM HIS WORDS.",
    "80C8FF8C": "Do not enter the Crucible to fight—NO. Enter to dominate. To crush. To conquer.",
    "80C8FF8E": "Show me what you've got.",
    "80C8FF92": "The Undying Mind. If we could kill it now, we would secure Luna from the Vex.",
    "80C8FF96": "But the Mind is moving between timelines, making copies of itself in hundreds upon thousands of different realities.",
    "80C8FF98": "A difficult problem with no elegant solution",
    "80C8FF9A": "I don't think we need elegance. We need brute force.",
    "80C8FF9C": "Imagine a portal tuned into the Undying Mind. One that would allow us to summon it from any timeline. ",
    "80C8FF9E": "If we had such a portal, we could kill it in hundreds upon thousands of different ways until there's nowhere and no when left to hide.",
    "80C8FFA0": "I think we can make such a portal. It won't be quick. It won't be easy.",
    "80C8FFA2": "But if we hold the line and work together, we can do it.",
    "80C8FFA4": "Vex are leaving the Garden by the dozens. We don't know why.",
    "80C8FFA6": "Report to Eris if you can spare the time, Guardian. We'll need your help with this.",
    "80C8FFA8": "This is it, Guardian. This is our chance to kill the Undying Mind for good and contain the Vex on Luna.",
    "80C8FFAA": "The portal works. Zavala and I tested it ourselves—two dozen times.",
    "80C8FFAC": "That's two dozen timelines where the Undying Mind will never return.",
    "80C8FFAE": "Still. Hundreds, thousands more timelines remain. It will take all of us working together to stop this.",
    "80C8FFB0": "Gather your fireteam. Fine-tune your loadouts. It's time for us to do what we Guardians do best.",
    "80C8FFB2": "Get in there and fight.",
    "80C8FFB4": "The Black Garden lies open. As we speak, Vex are spilling out onto the Moon, drawn by the Pyramid's influence.",
    "80C8FFB6": "Countless more are sure to follow. Our problems, it seems, are multiplying.",
    "80C8FFB8": "If the Vex drive us off the Moon, we'll lose our access to the Pyramid—and with it, any hope of stopping the Nightmares.",
    "80C8FFBA": "This threat must be contained. Before it grows beyond our ability to contain it.",
    "80C8FFBC": "My focus must remain fixed on the Pyramid. This task, then, must fall to you. You and Ikora both.",
    "80C8FFBE": "Push the Vex back. Learn what you can of their intentions. And bring your findings to Ikora.",
    "80C8FFC0": "Light the path for one another, and we may yet survive this complication.",
    "80C8FFC2": "See it through, Guardian.",
    "80C8FFC4": "I've been studying incoming recon data from Luna. It all points to the same thing.",
    "80C8FFC6": "The Vex have resurrected an ancient Hydra that we call 'The Undying Mind.'",
    "80C8FFC8": "The name says it all, really.",
    "80C8FFCA": "We've fought it many times before. Its primary directive is to take control of the Black Garden.",
    "80C8FFCC": "Its secondary directives could result in the destruction of the Traveler.",
    "80C8FFCE": "It's moving between timelines, hiding itself. It's learned from its past mistakes.",
    "80C8FFD0": "But so have we.",
    "80C8FFD2": "I'll come up with a plan. But I need time, and I need more data. I'm counting on you.",
    "80C8FFD4": "I take it you've already spoken to Ikora?",
    "80C8FFD6": "I'm glad you're taking this Vex business seriously. Sometimes, I worry that all your successes will blind you.",
    "80C8FFD8": "After all, what are a few Vex on the moon to a Guardian who has killed gods?",
    "80C8FFDA": "The Vex would not press us now if they did not think they could win.",
    "80C8FFDC": "They operate on pure probability, and I'm sure you are key in their calculations.",
    "80C8FFDE": "But I trust you. Lead the charge.",
    "80C8FFE0": "I'll be handling the rest of our regular operations.",
    "80C8FFE2": "Good luck out there. Be brave.",
    "80C8FFEE": "Welcome to the Tower, Guardian.",
    "80C8FFF2": "Beautiful view, isn't it? The Traveler is battle-worn and as mysterious as ever.",
    "80C8FFF4": "But it remains the source of our immortality—and the gift of our Light.",
    "80C8FFF6": "The City below All those people—survivors, fighters.",
    "80C8FFF8": "We are all that's left of humanity, and it's our duty to defend it by reclaiming our solar system from the enemies at our gates.",
    "80C8FFFA": "Get to know the Tower, Guardian. You have many allies here.",
    "80C8FFFC": "Then, when you're ready to get back in the fight",
    "80C8FFFE": "I've got a long list of hard targets ready for you to strike—alone or with your fireteam.",
    "80C90621": "Captain! I received word of the Cayde unit's life status.",
    "80C90625": "Donezo.",
    "80C90627": "Please let me know if there is anything I can do to accelerate and conclude your grief process.",
    "80C90629": "'Cause I'm fine. ",
    "80C9062B": "Anecdote! As the AI of Exodus Black, I experienced the death of every single one of my crewmembers!",
    "80C9068C": "I hypothesized that the more loss one has suffered, the easier subsequent losses become!",
    "80C9068F": "Field research has proven my hypothesis false!",
    "80C90695": "Losing Cayde makes me feel f-f-feel f-f-f-feel",
    "80C9069C": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH'",
    "80C906A2": "I feel terrible!",
    "80C9092A": "Crota. Oryx. Ghaul. The list of those who have tried to strip us of our Light goes on and on.",
    "80C90A7E": "But this new threat They will be like nothing we've faced before.",
    "80C90A82": "I've often wondered about the Collapse. About how it might have been different had Guardians been there.",
    "80C90A8C": "But I don't have to wait for them to come back to have my answer.",
    "80C90A9A": "It's already standing right in front of me.",
    "80C90B17": "They claim to be our salvation.",
    "80C90B1B": "No. We will be theirs.",
    "80C9092D": "Here comes the big hero. Heard about what you folks did out there. You proved me right. Clans make us braver and better.",
    "80C90931": "Least I can do is give you this.",
    "80C909DD": "In some ways—don’t laugh—the Red War was a gift. It gave us purpose and unity. Case in point: Clans.",
    "80C90B75": "Time for us to use that gift. Show me what you can do with clanmates by your side.",
    "80C90C9C": "[wry laugh] So, it's the end of everything. I thought after the Red War, we'd get a bit of a break.",
    "80C90C9F": "I'm not giving up yet.",
    "80C90CA0": "If nothing else, the Vex are methodical.",
    "80C90CA1": "They'd have a schematic of the Forest—a map. And that map will show where Panoptes is.",
    "80C90CA2": "There's only one place they could possibly store that much data: the Pyramidion on Io.",
    "80C90CA3": "I refuse to allow us to come this close to victory and fail. Sagira's sacrifice has to mean something.",
    "80C90CA4": "You know where Panoptes waits. As does Osiris. He will try to fight it on his own. And without our help, he will die. And without Sagira",
    "80C90CA5": "Only she could open the gateway. She was our key.",
    "80C90CA6": "Osiris may have taught me everything he knew about being a Warlock. But that's not everything I know.",
    "80C90CA7": "You must return to Mercury. And this time, I will go with you.",
    "80C90CA8": "Even with the entire Infinite Forest at their disposal, the Vex couldn't predict the Traveler's awakening. Or you.",
    "80C90CA9": "It gives me hope that any of us can defy expectations—can change. Sagira certainly has. And even Osiris seems less like Osiris. In a good way.",
    "80C90CB1": "All things must end, even something as special as the Dawning.",
    "80C90CB4": "But it's not over yet. And I have one last gift for you, my friend.",
    "80C90CB6": "Let's send the Dawning off in style.",
    "80C90CB7": "I love this holiday. It's the one time of the year when even Zavala smiles.",
    "80C90CB8": "This is for you. Enjoy the Dawning, Guardian. You've earned it.",
    "80C90CBA": "This is the season of the Dawning. A holiday created from a thousand traditions, brought together to rejoice in the Light.",
    "80C90CBB": "And this Dawning, with the Traveler shining above us? We have so much more to celebrate.",
    "80C90CBC": "But, as Cayde would remind me, this is also a time for gifts and games. To forget all of our troubles.",
    "80C90CBD": "I have just the thing picked out for you.",
    "80C90CC4": "On the edge of the Reef lies a wasteland called the Tangled Shore. That's where you'll find Uldren. ",
    "80C90CC7": "I won't stop you from going. As for Zavala",
    "80C90CC8": "He would cling to the broken pieces of the future he imagined until they crumble in his hand.",
    "80C90CC9": "He hasn't seen what I've seen. ",
    "80C90CCA": "Ever since the Traveler woke, it's been speaking to me. Visions of crowns, roses, silver trees. Candles that turn into bonfires.",
    "80C90CCB": "And I'm not the only one. If you see something new don't be afraid to pursue it.  ",
    "80C90CCC": "I wish I could help you more. But the City needs a unified Vanguard. Or at least the illusion of one. ",
    "80C90CCD": "And this is your road, now.",
    "80C90CCE": "I realized the other day Cayde may have been my healthiest relationship. ",
    "80C90CCF": "My Hidden agents I must keep at a distance. Zavala and I rarely see eye-to-eye anymore. My Ghost and I—it's complicated. And Osiris?",
    "80C90CD0": "You know that story.",
    "80C90CD1": "As for you I have only ever been a supporting character in your story. ",
    "80C90CD2": "But Cayde was just my friend. My ridiculous, funny, constant friend. ",
    "80C90CD3": "If we don't fight for our friends, what are we fighting for? ",
    "80C90CD4": "What I'm trying to say is I'm proud of you. And thank you. ",
    "80C90CDD": "Future War Cult foresaw this triumph. With the help of our loyal Guardians, we have cemented our high standing in the eyes of the City and won support for our long-term plans.",
    "80C90CE1": "Behold what a victorious Future War Cult can do for you.",
    "80C90CE3": "You made a poor choice, but then, not all of us can predict what will happen as precisely as Future War Cult can. I am sure you will choose more wisely next time.",
    "80C90CE5": "This victory has put me in a welcoming mood. While it lasts, you are welcome to try out our armaments.",
    "80C90CE7": "When Future War Cult predicted the Red War, no one believed. They laughed at us. They called me a zealot. A fool But when the attack came, we were ready. We saved thousands.",
    "80C90CE9": "War is a constant. We know this. The question is—do we wait for it to find us, or do we study war and its timelines, identify the most likely course of events, and take the fight to our enemies?",
    "80C90CEB": "You know the answer, Guardian.",
    "80C90CF2": "Emperor Calus, exalted be his name, was unsure of your conviction. But that Vex Mind died screaming. I heard it.",
    "80C90CF5": "The emperor was charmed by how you forced your way aboard Leviathan. Such wild abandon. Delicious.",
    "80C90CF7": "To obtain true power, you must give in to the ruthless aggression you exhibited today. Gorge freely on its exquisite, savage reveries.",
    "80C90CF9": "Anytime you wish to dance with death: Leviathan welcomes you.",
    "80C90CFA": "You have exceeded the emperor’s expectations. He sees now you are unafraid to indulge your true appetites.",
    "80C90CFC": "The emperor believes you are ready to be taught. As he was taught.",
    "80C90CFE": "Personally, I think you just like shiny things.",
    "80C90CFF": "But what do I know? I live in a closet.",
    "80C90D00": "In time, His Gloriousness will send for you. Until then, grow fat from strength.",
    "80C8FF77": "The exalted Emperor Calus is pleased with your efforts.",
    "80C8FF78": "The situation on the Leviathan with that troublesome Val Ca'uor caused our Most Opulent Benefactor some consternation.",
    "80C8FF79": "Your intervention demonstrated to His Gloriousness your willingness to do what is necessary.",
    "80C8FF7A": "And while his predilections tend toward excess, the Emperor admires your capacity for wanton violence.",
    "80C8FF7B": "Feel free to return to his Leviathan. Survive its challenges, and my lord will reward you gratuitously for your victory.",
    "80C90D0F": "Well done. The Iron Lords could have used you in the Dark Age.",
    "80C90D12": "You remind me of Efrideet.",
    "80C90D13": "Too many of our plans came down to...",
    "80C90D14": "'Get Efrideet a gun.'",
    "80C90D15": "I never met anyone who was better with a firearm ... until today. You have eclipsed her.",
    "80C90D17": "I look forward to your next conquest. And I will mourn your opponents.",
    "80C90D18": "So the rumors are true. Osiris has returned.",
    "80C90D19": "He’s dangerous. I don’t care what he says or what fool adventure he’s led you on.",
    "80C90D1A": "Remember. Ikora restored the Warlock orders after Osiris was exiled. She shaped this City. He abandoned it.",
    "80C90D1B": "Enough talk. The Iron Banner awaits. Let’s see what you’ve learned.",
    "80C90D1D": "Guardian! Welcome to the Iron Banner: A tournament where feats of might are demanded--and rewarded.",
    "80C90D1F": "The relics you’ll win here have been preserved through the ages: from a time when the Iron Lords watched over humanity.",
    "80C90D20": "This tournament honors the old ways. We celebrate the combat techniques and the battles that built the City.",
    "80C90D21": "Your role is simple. Just be what you are:",
    "80C90D22": "A shining example to Guardians everywhere.",
    "80C90D23": "Rasputin is NOT to be trusted. That War Mind will do anything to get what it needs.",
    "80C90D24": "Felwinter hoped Rasputin would help us.",
    "80C90D25": "That hope cost me my brothers and sisters in arms. The Iron Lords. I will NOT abide losing you, Guardian.",
    "80C90D27": "If it were up to me, we’d be at all-out war with Rasputin. But my time to lead is over. Our future is in your hands.",
    "80C90D28": "Show me how you’ve grown. The Iron Banner will prepare you for what’s coming.",
    "80C90D31": "You and your partner faced death and destruction together during these Crimson Days.",
    "80C90D34": "The Vanguard and I have done what we could to keep this City safe, but our efforts pale in comparison to yours.",
    "80C90D35": "Sometimes the Vanguard are so preoccupied with their own agendas-",
    "80C90D36": "they miss the legends of tomorrow rising before their eyes.",
    "80C90D37": "Revel in this.",
    "80C90D38": "The Crimson Days.",
    "80C90D39": "We use these holidays to honor friendship. Camaraderie. Love, for those of us lucky enough to find it.",
    "80C90D3B": "Today is a celebration! And oh, how I’ve reveled in its making. You and your chosen partner--your Crimson Bond--will take on all comers in my Crucible...",
    "80C90D3C": "To prove whose bond reigns supreme.",
    "80C90D3D": "Don’t do it for me, Guardian. Do it for your Crimson Bond.",
    "80C90D44": "Zavala wasn't thrilled about you running off after Cayde's killers. Can't say I blame him",
    "80C90D48": "Just tell me you got 'em.",
    "80C90D4A": "What? Even I know duty and obligation don't always line up.",
    "80C90D4C": "That's why I like you, Guardian. You don't just deal in justice, you embody it.",
    "80C90D4E": "Keep up the good fight. I'm rooting for you.",
    "80C90D54": "It's good to celebrate, and to be thankful. It's especially good to remember our past.",
    "80C90D57": "But it's also important to think of small gestures that might make our favorite friends feel appreciated.",
    "80C90D58": "I have a gift for you, Guardian. Just a little something from everyone here at the Farm. Happy Dawning.",
    "80C90D61": "We need something to draw out Xol. Something worth feeding on. ",
    "80C90D64": "So here's the plan. We intercepted Cabal radio transmissions regarding a piece of the Traveler that fragmented during Ghaul's assault.",
    "80C90D65": "We don't know the fragment's exact location, but Xol cannot resist being drawn to its Light. ",
    "80C90D66": "Gather intel and find that fragment.",
    "80C90D67": "The Traveler's light has illuminated a path into a world of immense change. But the brighter the light, the deeper the shadows.",
    "80C90D68": "How we choose to navigate that path, that will define us for years to come. ",
    "80C90D69": "But in all this uncertainty, one thing has never wavered. And that is my faith that you are the one who will lead the way forward. ",
    "80C90D6F": "Do not think for a moment that I shed a tear over Uldren's death.",
    "80C90D73": "In another life I would have killed him myself. ",
    "80C90D75": "But we are Guardians. One life is nothing when weighed against the lives of an entire people on the very precipice of extinction.",
    "80C90D77": "When you pursued vengeance into a foreign dominion, you put all of those lives at risk.",
    "80C90D79": "The death of Uldren Sov will have its consequences. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow.",
    "80C90D7B": "But the day will come. ",
    "80C90D7D": "I hope we will survive it. ",
    "80C90D7F": "I thought you'd be gone by now.",
    "80C90D81": "I would attempt to dissuade you from your course, but it would only insult us both.",
    "80C90D83": "As it stands, we've got every available Guardian dealing with escapees from the Prison of Elders. It's still not enough.",
    "80C90D85": "If you go to war with the Reef, it's a war you will have to fight alone. The Vanguard cannot help you. ",
    "80C9140C": "Do you remember this day, my friend?",
    "80C91410": "It was to be a commemoration of our past victories. A celebration of us Guardians. But while you were thousands of miles away the Red Legion struck.",
    "80C91412": "They took everything from us. Our Light our friends our home.",
    "80C91414": "The memory is never far from my mind.",
    "80C91415": "But even inside our memories, we must always be ready for what is next—and so, the time has come again for you to journey into your past.",
    "80C91416": "What challenges you there will be different from what you remember. Rise to this new challenge, and even greater glory will be yours.",
    "80C91418": "With everything you've been through, everything you've accomplished, everything you've done for us I shouldn't be surprised.",
    "80C9141A": "You exemplify the hero the City celebrates. And now you have armor fit for such a champion.",
    "80C9141C": "Wear it with pride, my friend. You're ready for whatever the future brings.",
    "80C9141E": "You carry relics of when we were at our lowest.",
    "80C9141F": "Wear them now at your own risk. Wear them to remember what it was like for us to be mortal.",
    "80C91421": "Wear them during this time of celebration, and the elements themselves will grant you gifts.",
    "80C91422": "Then reforge them into something stronger. Just as Humanity has reforged itself over these many years.",
    "80C93540": "The Iron Banner is looking for a Light like yours.",
    "80C93543": "I need an operative, and your will is strong.",
    "80C93545": "The Iron Banner needs your Light, Guardian.",
    "80C93547": "Will you act as a herald of the Iron Banner?",
    "80C93549": "The Iron Banner aims to forge better Guardians. Show us you can rise to the occasion.",
    "80C9354A": "I need you, and your Light, in the field.",
    "80C9354B": "I need a warrior of Light.",
    "80C9354D": "I have another challenge to pit against your Light.",
    "80C9354E": "I hope you understand what I ask of you.",
    "80C9354F": "You're powerful. Let's see how powerful.",
    "80C93551": "Iron Banner affairs extend beyond the arena.",
    "80C93552": "I need your cunning.",
    "80C93553": "Something new today, Guardian. A mission.",
    "80C93555": "No weakness. I want a real fight.",
    "80C93556": "Brace your Light against THIS, Guardian.",
    "80C93558": "Crucible combat, Guardian. Show me.",
    "80C9355A": "Your generation doesn't respect Light as you should. One day you may have to.",
    "80C9355B": "Respect your Light. It could mean the difference between life and death out there.",
    "80C9355C": "Your stare is cold. Can you keep that composure in battle?",
    "80C9355D": "Focus, Guardian! It's time to fight.",
    "80C9355F": "Battles rage as we stand here, Guardian. Will you join them?",
    "80C93561": "Instead of idling here, testing my resolve, you could be fighting for the armor of the Iron Banner.",
    "80C93563": "Lady Jolder once told me that when Guardians found endless battle, we would finally have a purpose for our immortality.",
    "80C93564": "Lord Radegast would have wept to see the Tower fall. He would have rebuilt it, even if he had to seal himself into the foundation as the central pillar.",
    "80C93565": "In our day, the Iron Lords would have routed the Cabal in response to the Tower attack.  The task is yours now, Guardian. Make us proud.",
    "80C93567": "A Shard of the Traveler in the European Dead Zone. Sounds straight out of a child's fairy tale.",
    "80C93568": "How long has it been since you defeated SIVA? All that you've accomplished, and they haven't made you Vanguard yet? I suppose it's a little soon. You don't want that anyway. It's an exercise in parley. Limited violence. Not like the Iron Banner.",
    "80C9356A": "The Red Legion laid low. All that you've accomplished, and they haven't made you Vanguard yet? I suppose it's a little soon. You don't want that anyway. It's an exercise in parley. The Iron Banner is war.",
    "80C9356C": "SIVA wasn't the only legend the Iron Lords kept track of. The network of War Mind bunkers on this world is vast, and the Golden Age relics they hold are numerous. With the Traveler returned, perhaps it's time to quest for them once more.",
    "80C9356D": "Throughout the ages, I never thought I would look up to see the Traveler live and breathe. What does it want? What will it do? My time has passed. Those are questions for you to answer, Guardian.",
    "80C9356F": "The Iron Banner is a celebration of  survival. Of the Collapse. Of the Dark Age. It is a remembrance of the Iron Lords who fought to protect humanity.",
    "80C93570": "The Traveler has returned. If it gave us the power of immortality ... Could we ask it to bring back others who have passed?",
    "80C93571": "The Iron Lords were my brothers and sisters in arms. My family. There were so many of us ... more than the histories remember. More than those who died the fateful day that we disbanded.",
    "80C93572": "I hold this Iron Banner to test your skills. To forge new armor in the old ways, so that Guardians of today might see how the Iron Lords of yesterday dragged humanity out of the Collapse.",
    "80C93573": "What does it mean to fight in the old ways? It was arduous. We built our equipment out of scraps. There were no weapon foundries then. Just Lord Silimar. No Shaxx to whip rookies into shape. Just Lady Jolder, who hit us until we learned to take it. And hit back.",
    "80C93574": "The Iron Lords helped usher humanity out of darkness following a world-ending collapse at the end of the Golden Age. From there we located and secured powerful relics from that era. That was our mistake. Some relics were better off forgotten. The original Lords were slain, their immortality negated, by a nanotechnology called SIVA.",
    "80C93575": "Your Vanguard missions serve the good of the City. But your battles in the Iron Banner make you a better Guardian.",
    "80C93577": "Your Vanguard missions prove your power. But you have a duty to the Iron Banner.",
    "80C93578": "It was once the Iron Banner, not the Vanguard, that drafted your missions. Perhaps, one day, it will again.",
    "80C93579": "Vanguard missions can be grueling. But this City needs you.",
    "80C9357A": "Your Vanguard record is impressive. The Iron Banner forges Guardians to do good work.",
    "80C9357B": "Vanguard work will stoke your Light. But don't forget to refine it--in the Iron Banner.",
    "80C9357C": "You made it back from another Vanguard mission, I see. It never truly ends, and will continue even when the Last City becomes the First City.",
    "80C9357D": "You've shown the Vanguard the strength of your Light. But it can be honed in the Iron Banner.",
    "80C9357F": "Don't hold back. When the match starts, your friends are your opponents.",
    "80C93580": "The other Guardians? They don't matter. Overcome yourself.",
    "80C93581": "No mercy in the Iron Banner. Your fellow Guardians will respect you for it. Bonds between allies are forged not only through teamwork--but rivalry.",
    "80C93582": "Your performance in the Crucible is impressive, but it would be better with greater Light. No--don't tell me. The response is always 'I've hit the ceiling. This is as far as I can go.' Do you think we said that at Six Fronts?",
    "80C93584": "The Iron Lords are watching, Guardian. But don't do it for them. Do it for your Light, for yourself. Your Light is a dragon. It lives inside you.",
    "80C93586": "I've seen your Crucible matches, Guardian. You're as powerful as you are silent.",
    "80C93588": "The Iron Banner determines whose Light is strongest. The Crucible issafer.",
    "80C93589": "How will your Light grow swifter by standing here, Hunter?",
    "80C9358B": "Careful, Hunter. You're within striking distance.",
    "80C9358D": "Your Light won't grow in strength as you stand here, Titan.",
    "80C9358F": "I'd offer to compare the strength of our Light, but I don't want you limping into the next match.",
    "80C93591": "How will you stoke the fire of your Light by standing here, Warlock?",
    "80C93593": "Want to see if you can project Light faster than my fist can reach you, Warlock?",
    "80C93595": "You know battle. Do you know your Light?",
    "80C93596": "You're one of the best. The Iron Banner breaks the best.",
    "80C93598": "A Guardian is a greater challenge than any external enemy.",
    "80C9359A": "Light isn't a complement to your weapons. It IS your weapon.",
    "80C9359B": "I know you're ready for the Iron Banner, Guardian.",
    "80C9359D": "Will your Light prove its swiftness, Hunter?",
    "80C9359F": "I know you're fast, Hunter. Can you be lethal?",
    "80C935A1": "The Iron Banner is looking for Hunters.",
    "80C935A3": "Your Light proves your strength, Titan.",
    "80C935A5": "You're powerful, Titan. But can you be fast?",
    "80C935A7": "The Iron Banner wants you, Titan.",
    "80C935A9": "Warlock--your Light is a weapon. Let me see its glory.",
    "80C935AB": "You're sharp, Warlock. But how are you in a fight?",
    "80C935AD": "The Iron Banner is always looking for Warlocks.",
    "80C935AF": "The Iron Banner does not aim to be gracious.",
    "80C935B0": "This won't be easy. Nothing worth doing is easy.",
    "80C935B1": "Bring your fiercest Light. You'll need it.",
    "80C935B2": "Your Light is what makes you a Guardian. Come test it.",
    "80C935B3": "The Iron Banner is war. Are you prepared to fight it?",
    "80C935B4": "The old way is best. The Iron Banner is the old way.",
    "80C935B5": "No limits in the Iron Banner.",
    "80C935B6": "The old ways are better.",
    "80C935B7": "Before the Vanguard, the Iron Lords were the authority.",
    "80C935B8": "The Iron Lords are watching.",
    "80C935B9": "New Guardians in the Tower. They will learn.",
    "80C935BA": "Light doesn't grow unless you feed it worthy opponents.",
    "80C935BB": "You're facing your allies at their best. Come prepared.",
    "80C935BD": "The Iron Banner awaits. Find opponents. Test your might.",
    "80C935BE": "Grow stronger. You must. This City needs you.",
    "80C935BF": "This tournament celebrates the old ways. Come test your mettle.",
    "80C935C0": "The Iron Banner is an arms race. Can you win it?",
    "80C935C1": "Hone your Light, Guardian. No wasted effort. Ever.",
    "80C935C3": "Are you prepared for the Iron Banner?",
    "80C935C5": "Annihilate your opponents. Reap their glory.",
    "80C935C6": "Zavala needs you--but I need you, too.",
    "80C935C7": "Power AND control. Well done.",
    "80C935C8": "In the battle of Light versus Light, your will makes the difference.",
    "80C935C9": "A shining example, Guardian.",
    "80C935CB": "A fine example of knighthood.",
    "80C935CC": "I admire your fighting spirit.",
    "80C935CD": "You wield the Light with conviction.",
    "80C935CE": "You're here. Good.",
    "80C935CF": "It's time you faced the fury of Light unbridled.",
    "80C935D1": "Ready for a battle with no limits?",
    "80C935D3": "The Iron Banner has come, whether you seek it or not.",
    "80C935D5": "Light versus Light.",
    "80C935D6": "It's time to fight.",
    "80C935D7": "Don't try to impress me in the Crucible. Just get better.",
    "80C935D8": "To test your Light is to test everything.",
    "80C935D9": "Tower missions are important. But so are the old traditions.",
    "80C935DA": "Fight, Guardian. No one will fight for you.",
    "80C935DC": "Hunter. Let your Light guide your swiftness.",
    "80C935DE": "It's time to draw, Hunter.",
    "80C935E0": "The Iron Banner calls, Hunter.",
    "80C935E2": "Your Light is your power, Titan.",
    "80C935E4": "Titan. The Iron Banner wants you.",
    "80C935E6": "Make me proud, Titan.",
    "80C935E8": "Warlock! Your skill in battle and your skill with Light are the same.",
    "80C935EA": "The Iron Banner wants to put your cunning to use, warlock.",
    "80C935EC": "Show me your Light, Warlock.",
    "80C935EE": "In our prime, the Iron Lords would have avenged the attack on the Tower.",
    "80C935F0": "Felwinter would have embraced this battle with the Red Legion.",
    "80C935F1": "Gheleon. How you would have relished this Red War.",
    "80C935F2": "Weapons and armor can only do so much. Trust your Light. Feed it.",
    "80C935F3": "Being a Guardian means you wield the Light. That you're a protector of the last of humanity. That you have a duty to this Tower, to this City, to keep it safe.",
    "80C935F5": "To set limits on your Light is to stifle your potential. The Crucible is not enough. Embrace the Iron Banner.",
    "80C935F6": "Light is something you feed over time. That you grow. There is no windfall. There is no respite. If you arrive hoping you have what it takes--you won't.",
    "80C935F7": "The time has come, Guardians. The Iron Banner has returned.",
    "80C935F9": "To give your life so that others may live is to answer the highest calling. The Iron Lords answered with pride.",
    "80C935FA": "This will grow your Light.",
    "80C935FB": "May you grow from this.",
    "80C935FC": "You are worthy of this.",
    "80C935FE": "May this help you in your quest.",
    "80C935FF": "As Guardians, our battle never ends. May this aid you.",
    "80C93600": "With this, I acknowledge your power, Guardian.",
    "80C93602": "This means you have power. Use it well.",
    "80C93603": "A gift--from the old traditions.",
    "80C93604": "May this feed the dragon that is your Light.",
    "80C93605": "Take your Light to the stars, Guardian.",
    "80C93607": "Into the fire, Guardian.",
    "80C93609": "Keep growing your Light.",
    "80C9360A": "I enjoy our time together, Guardian. Let's hope you come back in one piece.",
    "80C9360C": "Come back stronger.",
    "80C9360E": "Then go. Be the Guardian we need you to be.",
    "80C93610": "Your Light is a dragon. Feed it.",
    "80C93611": "You can't pave the way to the future if you don't respect the bones of the past.",
    "80C93612": "Bonds can break, Guardian. Even ones between Iron Lords. Light does not.",
    "80C93614": "Your Light will guide you home. Trust in it.",
    "80C93615": "Then I leave this to you.",
    "80C93616": "Soon, your Light will be blinding.",
    "80C93617": "Then you've proven your power.",
    "80C93619": "Now that's power, Guardian.",
    "80C9361B": "Your Light has fed well today.",
    "80C9361D": "That was a battle well-fought.",
    "80C9361E": "You played the part well, Guardian.",
    "80C93620": "You executed well.",
    "80C93621": "Brave. I like that.",
    "80C93623": "You're back. Your Light must have protected you.",
    "80C93624": "I see you survived my test.",
    "80C93626": "You survived. I hope you've learned something.",
    "80C93628": "Yes! Success!",
    "80C93629": "Then honor is satisfied.",
    "80C9362A": "Why mourn what was lost? Fight to grow your Light, and protect what you have.",
    "80C9362B": "What was lost will never return. Allow it to weigh on your soul, and it will destroy you.",
    "80C9362D": "No one knows loss like an Iron Lord.",
    "80C9362E": "'The Dawning?' Sounds like some outmoded ritual.",
    "80C9362F": "The Dawning. I know what it is. And I don't approve.",
    "80C93630": "Everyone's talking about the Dawning. I came to see Light versus Light.",
    "80C93631": "The Iron Banner is older--nobler--than the Crimson Days.",
    "80C93632": "I don't understand young Guardians anymore.",
    "80C93633": "My Crimson Bond? I don't have one. And no, I won't be yours.",
    "80C93634": "I pointed you, and you sought--destroyed. I could have used you at Six Fronts.",
    "80C93635": "With more like youwith more like you, perhaps the Iron Lords would never have faded.",
    "80C93636": "You fight well against your fellow Guardians. See that you continue to do so.",
    "80C93637": "All that you've done and you're still learning. Excellent.",
    "80C93639": "Today, you forged a new path.",
    "80C9363A": "Good. The Iron Lords would be pleased.",
    "80C9363B": "Your strength is impressive. I will call on it again.",
    "80C9363C": "It stirs my blood to see you represent the Iron Banner in the Crucible.",
    "80C9363D": "Cold and calculating. You served the Iron Banner well in there.",
    "80C9363F": "You tore the Crucible apart. That's good--every once in a while.",
    "80C93641": "A shining example of Light versus Light, Guardian.",
    "80C93643": "Shaxx won't admit it, but he was horrified to hear you would be representing the Iron Banner in there.",
    "80C93645": "Glimmer is the universal language.",
    "80C93648": "Have you gone offworld a lot? It's a scary idea to me, but one day I'll have to go back.",
    "80C93649": "There's a lot of side effects of being born in space. It took a while for me to adjust to the gravity.",
    "80C9364A": "The Guardians of the Mugunghwa Legion are counting on me.",
    "80C9364B": "It's a lot of work to manage a store. Not as dangerous as what you do, of course.",
    "80C9364C": "I never met my parents, but the Mungunghwa Legion is my family now.",
    "80C9364D": "That Zavala guy is a little scary. I try to stay out of the Vanguard's way.",
    "80C9364E": "I was just a child when they found me drifting in space. I barely remember any of it.",
    "80C9364F": "One day, I'm gonna find my parents. I know they're out there waiting for me.",
    "80C93650": "This is a tough line of work, but I love helping the Mugunghwa.",
    "80C93651": "Ramen is my favorite. Have you tried the noodle shop? It's perfect in the winter.",
    "80C93652": "I'm a little scared to go back into space. Something happened to my family when I was a child, but I need to be brave.",
    "80C93653": "How may I help you?",
    "80C93654": "You look like a customer with discerning taste.",
    "80C93655": "Please give our wares a try.",
    "80C93656": "Looking for something in particular?",
    "80C93657": "What can I interest you in today?",
    "80C93658": "Your patronage is appreciated.",
    "80C93659": "I want to help Guardians in any way I can.",
    "80C9365A": "I have some great deals today.",
    "80C9365B": "Shopping is one of life's great pleasures.",
    "80C9365C": "It's a beautiful day for shopping.",
    "80C9365D": "Any interest in our new merchandise?",
    "80C9365E": "Stop by and browse our wares.",
    "80C9365F": "We're open for business.",
    "80C93660": "I heard that Mugunghwa membership is growing.",
    "80C93661": "The new shipment is late. What's taking so long?",
    "80C93662": "Good day, good day. How may I help you?",
    "80C93663": "It's easy to get lost here.",
    "80C93664": "Slow day today. Hardly any visitors!",
    "80C93665": "I don't remember much from my childhood. One day, I'll find my past.",
    "80C93666": "If I save up a little more money, I can afford my own ship.",
    "80C93667": "I just need to work a little harder. I'm almost there.",
    "80C93668": "I hope I can move into a bigger venue one day.",
    "80C93669": "I love this job, but Mom and Dad are out there somewhere. When I find them, I can bring them back.",
    "80C9366A": "Ramen would be perfect right now. I'm so hungry, I could eat five bowls!",
    "80C9366B": "What a beautiful view from here.",
    "80C9366C": "Back already?",
    "80C9366D": "Did you forget something?",

    "80C93671": "I'm here if you need me.",
    "80C93672": "Welcome!",
    "80C93673": "We have a great selection. Take your time.",
    "80C93674": "You seem to have your eye on something.",
    "80C93675": "Our store is always open to you.",
    "80C93676": "Need some new equipment?",
    "80C93677": "We have the finest wares in the system.",
    "80C93678": "Come browse our store.",
    "80C93679": "I serve the Mugunghwa Legion.",
    "80C9367A": "I know you can handle any threat. Doesn't hurt to go in prepared.",
    "80C9367B": "I grew up without my parents, but I can call the Mugunghwa my new family.",
    "80C9367C": "When you're feeling stressed, you can relax by going on a shopping spree.",
    "80C9367D": "One day, I'll be as brave as you and set off to find my parents.",
    "80C9367E": "That's an excellent choice.",
    "80C9367F": "I hope it serves you well.",
    "80C93680": "That's a popular item.",
    "80C93681": "Thank you for your business.",
    "80C93682": "That's one of my favorites.",
    "80C93683": "Come back soon.",
    "80C93684": "Have a good day.",
    "80C93685": "Be safe.",
    "80C93686": "I'll be here when you return",
    "80C93687": "I'm glad you stopped by.",
    "80C93688": "Goodbye for now.",
    "80C9368A": "Hey, hero. Got somethin' you should look at.",
    "80C9368E": "Check this out, brother.",
    "80C93690": "Got somethin' dangerous for you to look at.",
    "80C93692": "You lookin' to get paid? I got work.",
    "80C93694": "Feel like a gunfight? Got one on its way.",
    "80C93696": "I might need a hand. You got my back?",
    "80C93698": "Need some extra Glimmer? I need a hand.",
    "80C9369A": "Got some work for your particular talents.",
    "80C9369C": "You lookin' for some work?",
    "80C9369E": "How you livin', brother? Feel like showin' all of us how Gambit's done?",
    "80C936A0": "Hey, anytime you're lookin' for a firefight, Gambit's waitin'.",
    "80C936A2": "I can always use your expertise out on the frontier. Get me those Motes.",
    "80C936A4": "What're you doin' out in the Tangled Shore all the time? How about Gambit?",
    "80C936A6": "Feel like huntin' some Primevals? There are always more.",
    "80C936A8": "Hey, you let me know whenever you feel like throwing some Taken at your friends. Ha!",
    "80C936AA": "Grab a couple of yer friends, and let's bag some Motes, yeah?",
    "80C936AC": "What do you say we get a gunfight goin' out in the dark?",
    "FFFFFFFF": "What did my crew find out there? Well, the Derelict's draggin' part of it. The bank. The portals. All my tech is only possible thanks to I'm sayin' too much.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "I seen what's comin'. I've been to the black edge. Wasn't the first. But I'm the only one who's ready. All this—Gambit—is all prep.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "I've got a lotta enemies. All of 'em want me dead. And that's fine. I'm still here. But there are a few just a few that I might need some help with some day. Just sayin'.",
    "80C936AE": "I didn't know Cayde well. Knew I didn't like him.",
    "80C936B0": "You lookin' to be a bad guy?",
    "80C936B2": "You ready to leave mercy behind?",
    "80C936B4": "So did you do it? Kill the bastard?",
    "80C936B6": "Did you do it? Cross that line?",
    "80C936B8": "Did you avenge your friend?",
    "80C936BA": "Hey, so are the rumors true? You the one who took out Prince What's-his-name?",
    "80C936BC": "Did you kill Prince Oodoo? I don't really care, but everyone's asking. Gotta blend in.",
    "80C936BE": "You over your rebel phase already, hero? Heard you're goin' around, helpin' the Dreaming City get back in order. What gives? What about Gambit?",
    "80C936C0": "Reef still goin' to hell? Wasn't the greatest place before. Definitely don't wanna live there now.",
    "80C936C2": "I been thinking 'bout taking the Derelict to the Dreaming City. Gambit could use some new war zones. No bigger war zone than that, these days.",
    "80C936C4": "Hey, heard you were up to no good out there. What happened? Rumors sayin' Ascendant portals opening up everywhere. Sometimes I think you're crazy.",
    "80C936C6": "See any Ahamkara bones out there? I don't have anything specific in mind. Just wonderin' how tasty they might be what kinda stews I could make.",
    "80C936C8": "Hey, I'm curious as the next fella about what you did out in the Dreaming City. But you know what? If they don't like it, to hell with 'em. How many times you save this pretty blue rock? How many times you save this reality? I know you know what you're doing. Trust.",
    "80C936CA": "I'm older 'n you think, kid. Got some spring in my step still, that's all.",
    "80C936CC": "My guns are older than my bones, but they still work. Dark Age weapons were the pinnacle of firearm tech.",
    "80C936CE": "I left this system years ago, went to the deep black with my crew. Wasn't many who made it back.",
    "80C936D0": "I haven't been back here in don't know how many centuries. Things have changed. Your Vanguard are soft.",
    "80C936D2": "What me an' my crew found out there at the black edge we couldn't tell if it was alive. We just knew it could make us stronger.",
    "80C936D4": "They say honor among thieves lasts only till you divvy the spoils. So it was with my crew. We knew only one of us could take it. My gun made it me.",
    "80C936D6": "I've made some enemies in my time, believe me. The things I kill are ugly. The things I couldn't well, they're pretty ugly too. Worse, 'cuz of the bullet wounds.",
    "80C936D8": "Well, to say that I watch my back is an understatement. Half this system is pissed at me. I'm hoping the centuries away have eased things.",
    "80C936DA": "What's Gambit for? Well, it's to make you rich, brother. Everything else is just a happy by-product.",
    "80C936DC": "You know, bein' the invader in Gambit that feeling of empowerment? That's what the Taken feel. I'm just sayin'. Light isn't the only source o' power out there.",
    "80C936DE": "Brother, let me tell ya, when you're out there in Gambit, starin' down a Primeval, just know they're as scared o' you as you are of them. Haha! Just kiddin'. Make 'em bleed.",
    "80C936E0": "The bank is what draws the enemies of Humanity out to meet ya in the arenas. And causes their subsequent death to form a Mote of Dark. You don't care, but I worked hard on that thing.",
    "80C936E2": "I've got Gambit arenas all over this system. Right under Shaxx and his Redjacks' noses. It's pretty funny.",
    "80C936E4": "I wanna see you invade when we get out there, ya hear? Keep yer friends on their toes.",
    "80C936E6": "I pay you young bloods partly 'cuz you're crazy, and I like it when you're crazy in Gambit. But I pay you to keep quiet, too. Don't go mouthing off to the Crucible Handler or the Commander. Would be a real quick way to get this operation shut down.",
    "80C936E8": "I see some o' you lookin' at me like I'm nuts. You think all this—Gambit—is for nothin'? That I do this 'cuz I LIKE it? Brother, you don't know the half of it.",
    "80C936EA": "Yeah, I knew the Iron Lords. Buncha do-gooders. They always surprised me by not dying. Over and over. Then they helped build a City. None of 'em could shoot worth a damn, though, save one. Lady Efrideet.",
    "80C936EC": "Do you like my dingy hallway? I like my dingy hallway. Your Vanguard never come back here. Buncha softies. Don't turn out like them, ya hear? You're better than that.",
    "80C936EE": "My crew and I worked real hard to put this operation together. Motes of Light have always been a thing. Motes of Dark? I had to make 'em. One day, I may have to answer for that. But you got my back, right? Haha.",
    "80C936F0": "Once Gambit really gets rolling, nothing, no one, is gonna stop us. Not all the Light in the universe. And not the Dark, either. Deadlier guns than mine set us on this path long ago.",
    "80C936F2": "Nice to see Ahamkara bones are still all the rage. The kids loved them back in the day, too. Tore open all kinds of gaps in the fabric of reality. When the Warlock orders stepped in to put a stop to it, I was pissed at the time. But they were probably right.",
    "80C936F4": "I've had people tell me, 'This is dumb. He can see you. You're standing right here.' But can he? It's been working so far. How do you find one Light in a sea of Lights?",
    "80C936F6": "This is gonna take some time. But when we're done, I'll have a battle-ready crew. One man can't fight an army.",
    "80F5D6F0": "I've had many crews. One in the Dark Age, one in the City Age Hell, I got one now. It's never the same folks. Not my fault, but they just keep dyin' off. You be careful 'round me, you hear? Hah.",
    "80C936FA": "This system is bigger than it used to be. I hear the Nine set up shop somewhere nearby. Made a little pocket playground for themselves. Sounds like a new Gambit arena to me",
    "80C936FC": "Emissary of the Nine, huh? She can't fool me. Change all you want, sister. Once you have it, you never really leave the Light behind.",
    "80C936FE": "All the stars in heaven I am so hungry. That's the thing with this hallway. Can't catch anything. I'd drink Vex milk at this point.",
    "80C93700": "So those new kids on the block the Scorn? That's some interesting biology. I'm sure I could find a use for that flammable blood.",
    "80C93702": "Back in my day, we never would have let the Cabal take the City. We would have destroyed it ourselves and stared them down as they rolled in. You all are a little soft. I mean, you're OK.",
    "80F5D6F2": "I gotta raid one of those Tex Mechanica foundries at some point. Closest thing to a Dark Age piece you can get. I know HE has. I seen no shortage of guns from him. ",
    "80C93706": "How much time do I have? Probably less than I think. That man? He's a-comin'. ",
    "80C93708": "Gambit could always use another gun. We're building to something big. Come be a part of it before it's too late.",
    "80C9370A": "Come closer. I don't bite. 'Less I'm hungry.",
    "80C9370C": "You're lookin' spry.",
    "80C9370E": "I see you. Let's talk.",
    "80C93710": "Let's do business.",
    "80C93712": "You looking to do business?",
    "80C93714": "What say we get this over with?",
    "80C93716": "Come on. Let's get this done.",
    "80C93718": "You find Motes out there, you bring 'em to me.",
    "80C9371A": "The bullet always comes when you're not movin'.",
    "80C9371C": "If I see you, that means I got you.",
    "80C9371E": "Crimson Days? Young people are weird.",
    "80C93720": "No, I won't be your Crimson Bond. Too busy.",
    "80C93722": "The Dawning? How 'bout you celebrate by getting more Motes?",
    "80C93724": "I don't give gifts. Happy to take 'em though.",
    "80C93726": "You see any Ahamkara bones out there, you let me know.",
    "80C93728": "Playing hero in the Reef, huh?",
    "80C9372A": "Is the Awoken Queen back? What's goin' on out there?",
    "80C9372C": "What did you do out in the Reef? Somethin' feels off.",
    "80C9372E": "Make any wishes lately? Ha!",
    "80C93730": "So, Cayde's out. Surprised it took this long.",
    "80C93732": "Been to the Reef lately? Heard it's gone to hell.",
    "80C93734": "I leave for a couple centuries and everything's a mess.",
    "80C93736": "Heard you took out Prince what's-his-name.",
    "80C93738": "Heard you put the hurt on those Scorned Barons.",
    "80C9373A": "Good to see you alive, brother.",
    "80F5D6F4": "No more spiking my coffee with Vex milk. Can't get her voice outta my damn head.",
    "80F5D6F6": "Nothin' you say makes sense, sister. Ain't got time for your Sumerian poetry.",
    "80F5D6F8": "The mannequin sure likes to waste her breath. I should have her record my answering box.",
    "80F5D6FA": "I like when punks are killable. She eats bullets for lunch. I need a bigger gun.",
    "80F5D6FC": "I never thought I'd be haunted. How do you kill a spirit? And could I even eat it afterward?",
    "80F5D6FE": "Her voice is so damn loud—and I'm so hungry.",
    "80F5D700": "What the hell. It can't be her. After all these years?",
    "80F5D702": "Darlin'. What did they do to you? You go chasing myths, and they turn you into one.",
    "80F5D704": "No, no, no. Not her. Why'd it have to be her?",
    "80F5D706": "Oh, good job, Drifter. You keep pissing off just the right people.",
    "80F5D708": "I can tell you and your new friends wanna boil my brain, Orin. Not gonna happen. I'm already nuts.",
    "80C9373C": "Drifter needs more Motes, kids. What're they doing out there? Shooting blanks?",
    "80C9373E": "Motes of Light. Motes of Dark. You need a little o' both.",
    "80C93740": "Need to find me some new war zones. Hard to profit in peace.",
    "80C93742": "Time to build some new banks. These Lights have been busy.",
    "80C93744": "Never want more than you have. Focus.",
    "80C93746": "I can think of a few ways to spend these Motes. None of 'em pleasant.",
    "80C93748": "I KNOW the Vanguard know about the maintenance frame. So what're they doing?",
    "80C9374A": "This was probably the one place in the universe he wouldn't think to find me.",
    "80C9374C": "Come on, come on. Anyone wanna play Gambit? The dark don't wait.",
    "80C9374E": "Is there anywhere in this Tower you can't hear that one-horned idiot?",
    "80C93750": "The Derelict needs some new parts. I wonder if that mechanic overcharges. Probably.",
    "80C93752": "Gotta move, gotta move.",
    "80C93754": "Whole generation of Lightbearers with eternal life and this is all you got done?",
    "80C93756": "Why is that idiot always yelling? He should go INTO the Crucible.",
    "80C93758": "The new Vanguard's soft. And one's dead. You leave the system for a little while and everything goes to hell.",
    "80C9375A": "All outta Motes already. At least they're going to a good cause.",
    "80C9375C": "So the Cabal came and just TOOK the Tower? Wouldn't have happened back in the day. We would've burned it down first. Times change, I guess.",
    "80C9375E": "Tex Mechanica makes some decent pieces. Still doesn't get any better than Dark Age weaponry.",
    "80C93760": "Cayde's dead, and I need more guns. One step forward, one step back.",
    "80C93762": "Hey, hey! No need to go tellin' anyone we fly to remote corners of the system and throw Taken at each other.",
    "80C93764": "You lookin' for a gunfight? Gambit could use you.",
    "80C93766": "You ready to ship out? There's enemies of Humanity to shoot.",
    "80C93768": "Motes of Dark out there just waitin', brother. Go get some.",
    "80C9376A": "How 'bout some Gambit? You just standin' there.",
    "80C9376C": "Whaddya need? Talk to me.",
    "80C9376E": "You got somewhere to be? How about Gambit?",
    "80C93770": "Guardians are always welcome aboard the Derelict.",
    "80C93772": "How you livin'?",
    "80C93774": "Kill anything big lately?",
    "80C93776": "Gambit's always lookin' for Guardians. You in?",
    "80C93778": "Hey, look alive, hotshot.",
    "80C9377A": "You ready to bang knuckles?",
    "80C9377C": "What's up, hero?",
    "80C9377E": "It's the 'Chosen One.' Slay any Hive gods lately?",
    "80C93780": "Hey kid. Lookin' good.",
    "80C93782": "How you livin', brother?",
    "80C93784": "Call me Drifter.",
    "80C93786": "The things I've killed you wouldn't believe. You seen what the Derelict's dragging?",
    "80C93788": "There're things out in the dark that only the dark can overcome. Trust me.",
    "80C9378A": "Hey, you see Motes out there, you bring 'em to Drifter, ya hear?",
    "80C9378C": "Come on, come on. Who's up for Gambit?",
    "80C9378E": "Motes go in the bank, got it? And I'll make sure you get paid.",
    "80C93790": "I built the bank to contain exotic energies. And release them.",
    "80C93792": "All the tech I use in Gambit, I built. Kit-bashed, mostly.",
    "80C93794": "Hey, hey! Don't go tellin' the Vanguard about this. You'll get paid.",
    "80C93796": "Shaxx doesn't need to hear about Gambit, all right? You do you.",
    "80C93798": "Let's keep what goes on here between you 'n' me, all right?",
    "80C9379A": "Where do Primevals come from? Ascendant Plane. Oldest Taken I could find.",
    "80C9379C": "Don't waste this.",
    "80C9379E": "Be smart with this.",
    "80C937A0": "Yeah, that was made for you.",
    "80C937A2": "Don't break that, all right?",
    "80C937A4": "Careful with that.",
    "80C937A6": "You can scuff this up. It's what it's for.",
    "80C937A8": "This can take a beating and still work. Trust.",
    "80C937AA": "All yours. Beat it to hell.",
    "80C937AC": "It'll protect you if you protect it.",
    "80C937AE": "Reliable and sturdy, I guarantee.",
    "80C937B0": "Told you you'd get paid.",
    "80C937B2": "That's yours now.",
    "80C937B4": "Careful. Not a lot of these left.",
    "80C937B6": "Hang with Drifter, get cool stuff.",
    "80C937B8": "That's for you.",
    "80C937BA": "Be seein' you, brother.",
    "80C937BC": "Be safe out there, brother.",
    "80C937BE": "Come back alive, brother.",
    "80C937C0": "Don't die out there, brother.",
    "80C937C2": "Hurry back. Gambit's awaitin'.",
    "80C937C4": "You're always welcome on the Derelict.",
    "80C937C6": "I need you alive, brother. Be careful.",
    "80C937C8": "Watch your back out there, brother.",
    "80C937CA": "Hey, don't talk about Gambit out there.",
    "80C937CC": "Go throw some Taken at your friends.",
    "80C937CE": "Go be bad guys.",
    "80C937D1": "I think you're ready!",
    "80C937D5": "I've counted you on one of my crew for a while now. We've never been on a job together, but you've done more than your fair share.",
    "80C937D7": "Gambit. Findin' Callum. Building Malfeasance. You've mastered the frontier. Emphatically.",
    "80C937D9": "Speaking of Callum The man who went after him? He's been gunnin' for me fer centuries. The man with the Golden Gun",
    "80C937DB": "Because o' me, he just might come lookin' for you, too.",
    "80C937DD": "Everyone in the crew gets a new name. You should pick yours.",
    "80C937DF": "Dredgen.",
    "80C937E1": "I think you're ready!",
    "80C937E3": "I've counted you one of my crew for a while now. We've never been on a job together, but you've done more than your fair share.",
    "80C937E5": "And now you've mastered the frontier. Everyone who gets as good as you? My crew asks them to pick a name.",
    "80C937E7": "And you should pick yours soon.",
    "80C937E9": "Dredgen.",
    "80C937EB": "Hey, kid. How you livin'?",
    "80C937ED": "Don't answer that. Important thing is you're livin'. Even with all that Gambit you been up to. Don't think I haven't noticed.",
    "80C937EF": "You enjoy this, don't ya? You're not like the other Guardians. I disappear for a couple hundred years and everyone's gone all soft.",
    "80C937F1": "Not you, though. You coulda been ridin' right beside me in the Dark Age. For a little while, at least.",
    "80C937F3": "From here on out, your Gambit wins—and losses—count. I got my eye on you, kid. Don't disappoint me.",
    "80C937F5": "I can't tell if that look in your eye is determination or rage. Word is, you and Cayde had a pretty good partnership. That's rare. From what I could tell, that guy preferred to work alone.",
    "80C937F7": "Maybe he liked how you pulped a Hive god or two. I know that's why I like ya.",
    "80C937F9": "Listen, don't let his death weigh on you. Somewhere out there, someone's got a bullet with your name on it. Same for him. Same for me. Nothin' we can do.",
    "80C937FB": "So go out on your terms—with a gun in your hand and loot in your pockets. Haha! Only way to live.",
    "80C937FD": "The Derelict's always in orbit if you wanna vent.",
    "80C937FF": "Hey, you got everyone up here all riled up. They've been debatin' what happened to Prince What's-His-Name like it's a Crucible match.",
    "80C93801": "Tell you what: If you did what they say you did, you're exactly what I need for Gambit. Just sayin'.",
    "80C93803": "I knew when I saw you out there one'a you wasn't comin' back. And here you are!",
    "80C93805": "A little revenge feels good, doesn't it? But I can tell you from personal experience it doesn't last.",
    "80C93806": "Rage like that is a disease. Lucky for you, I've got the closest thing to a cure: Gambit. ",
    "80C93807": "Now get out there and crack some skulls.",
    "80C93808": "Welcome to Gambit, kid! Call me Drifter. Here, you're gonna compete against another fireteam in a hunt for the enemies of Humanity. I name 'em; you kill 'em.",
    "80C9380A": "Now they're gonna leave some stuff behind. Pick 'em up and drop 'em in the bank as proof that you're doing your job. Better you do your job, the rougher you make it for the other team.",
    "80C9380C": "But! There's a twist. Y'all are gonna have to bang knuckles, face-to-face, with the other team from time to time. And lemme tell ya, if there's one thing I've learned in all my travels: Nothin' kills a Guardian faster than another Guardian.",
    "80C9380E": "Woo! Get ready to be bad guys!",
    "80C93AE5": "Damn it! Calibration looks good. Signal is strong. And the Offering Wait. The Offering is missing.",
    "80C93AE9": "And this place, this city?",
    "80C93AEB": "The Awoken built hidden cities like this throughout the Reef. In some, we live and raise our children.",
    "80C93AED": "In others, we build our weapons. We train our armies—or we used to, when we had armies.",
    "80C93AEF": "Here, in the Dreaming City, we learn from greater powers. We meditate. We transcend. This is our most sacred place.",
    "80C93AF1": "You were right.",
    "80C93AF3": "There are no guides here. It is a place of scheming queens and traps unsprung.",
    "80C93AF5": "YOU! Why would you come here? There is no place less suited for the likes of you, walking in the dreamland of your enemies.",
    "80C93AF9": "What happened to Uldren?",
    "80C93AFB": "There is an immense creature at the heart of this place. But I cannot say more.",
    "80C93AFD": "The Queen must be the first to know. I'm sorry, my friends.",
    "80C93AFF": "Petra's ship. We're close.",
    "80C93B01": "It's working! My queen! Can you hear me?",
    "80C93B09": "Did you see the Queen's Techeuns?",
    "80C93B0A": "Yes. Three of them, all Taken. They attacked us while we were trying to find you.",
    "80C93B0C": "Kalli, Sedia, Shuro Chi. They were with Mara on the bridge",
    "80C93B0E": "I'm not sure. We were attacked by three women while we were trying to find you.",
    "80C93B10": "That's them. Mara's most trusted advisors—corrupted by the Taken.",
    "80C93B11": "Those women raised me.",
    "80C93B12": "If there's a way to save them, we must take it.",
    "80C93B13": "Those women look like the Queen's Techeuns",
    "80C93B15": "Those women used to be Awoken",
    "80C93B17": "I see. And this machine",
    "80C93B19": "The Techeuns call it an Oracle Engine. They say Queen Mara used it to walk between realities.",
    "80C93B1B": "No one knew where she went, but they used the Oracle to learn from her while she was gone.",
    "80C93B1D": "Mara has told me it's much more than that Perhaps you and I will see, someday.",
    "80C93B1F": "We found an Offering, Petra. The Scorn had it.",
    "80C93B21": "I should've known—vengeful thieves. Bring it up here.",
    "80C93B23": "Petra Venj. ",
    "80C93B25": "Mara! You're—alive! I'm so—I mean— ",
    "80C93B27": "My Queen.",
    "80C93B29": "And I see you brought the Guardian.",
    "80C93B2B": "Yes, forgive me, Your Grace. But I have news.",
    "80C93B2D": "Your brother, Prince Uldren is— ",
    "80C93B2F": "Dead. I know.",
    "80C93B31": "Of course. He—his soul was corrupted by the Taken. He suffered from delusions, which I now believe were caused by—",
    "80C93B33": "Riven.",
    "80C93B35": "Yes, m'lady. She, too, has been Taken, as have Kalli, Shuro, and Sedia.",
    "80C93B37": "So many loved ones turned against us",
    "80C93B39": "Tell me what to do, my lady. Please.",
    "80C93B3B": "Assemble a team, Petra. Send them into the heart of the City. Kill that creature and extract its heart.",
    "80C93B3D": "I offer the riches of our realm as bounty. Open the gates, and let the Guardians in.",
    "80C93B3F": "I must go. The battle rages on. If you have news, send it. I will answer as I am able. ",
    "80C93B41": "Stay strong, my Wrath. I believe in you.",
    "80C93B43": "We understand. Where is everyone? ",
    "80C93B45": "We evac'd just before the Taken War. Queen Mara ordered everything to be locked down.",
    "80C93B47": "Then she and the Techeuns sealed off the Watchtower, and Mara made a deal with the Spider.",
    "80C93B49": "Protect it, and she would turn a blind eye to his businesses.",
    "80C93B4B": "No one was supposed to come back here until everything was safe.",
    "80C93B4C": "But I'm so pleased that you can see this place, cousin. You, more than anyone, deserve answers.",
    "80C93B4E": "You're lucky to see this place, you know. It's sacred. Outsiders are forbidden.",
    "80C93B4F": "And what, am I to be your Virgil? A guide, a shepherd? [chuckle] No, no, no",
    "80C93B51": "We need to get this working. I must speak to the Queen. The fate of the Dreaming City is at stake.",
    "80C93B53": "Cousin! You made it.",
    "80C93B55": "Guardian! You made it.",
    "80C93B57": "Leave the Dreaming City while you still can, dear squanderer.",
    "80C93B59": "There. Watch this.",
    "80C93B5B": "You walk blind above an abyss, full of trust for a friendly voice. ",
    "80C93B5D": "You're playing right into her hands.",
    "80C93B5F": "There—Petra's ship. Follow her.",
    "80C93B60": "Something pulled Uldren to the Watchtower. ",
    "80C93B62": "Petra came here to find answers, and she asked you to watch her back. I'll be here to watch yours.",
    "80C93B64": "Let's get to high ground and find her.",
    "80C93B66": "There's something odd about this place. There's Light here, but also Darkness.",
    "80C93B68": "YOU'RE Awoken. Do you sense anything?",
    "80C93B6A": "I know what happened to Uldren. I've seen the evil that we face. I have to tell the Queen, or we are lost.",
    "80C93B6C": "You talk about her like she's alive.",
    "80C93B6E": "Uldren did, too.",
    "80C93B70": "Uldren—was not himself. He believed he heard her voice. I believe she lives.",
    "80C93B72": "Why?",
    "80C93B74": "She had a plan. She always had a plan. Queen Mara does not fail.",
    "80C93B76": "But whatever it was that spoke to Uldren was not our queen. It was that thing.",
    "80C93B78": "But whatever it was that spoke to Uldren was not my queen. It was that thing.",
    "80C93B7A": "'The dreary plain, forlorn and wild, the seat of desolation, void of light!' Ha!",
    "80C93B7C": "Mara Sov! My queen. Are you there? Can you hear me? ",
    "80C93B7E": "The Offering?",
    "80C93B80": "This is an Oracle. It can do nothing without an Offering. Maybe I can override it, somehow",
    "80C93B82": "We'll look around.",
    "80C93B84": "Yes. Mara Sov, Queen of the Awoken, LIVES.",
    "80C93B86": "I'm going to get my ship. Meet me when you can.",
    "80C93B96": "Guardian!",
    "80C93B9A": "Over here, Guardian.",
    "80C93B9C": "I have news.",
    "80C93B9E": "Guardian, what's your status?",
    "80C93BA0": "Approaching the observatory now.",
    "80C93BA1": "I'm trying to send you some backup. Bear with us.",
    "80C93BA2": "Come in, Guardian. ",
    "80C93BA4": "We're en route to the observatory. Everything's fine.",
    "80C93BA5": "No changes from last time?",
    "80C93BA6": "None that I've observed.",
    "80C93BA7": "Everything is as it was last time. ",
    "80C93BA9": "The Taken have laid claim to the observatory and sealed off all ground access.",
    "80C93BAB": "Petra and I met last night to plan a defense. We thought to fight magic with magic.",
    "80C93BAD": "But when I reached for my powers to cast a ward of protection, I found—nothing. ",
    "80C93BAF": "So, Petra led a unit to secure the observatory on foot.",
    "80C93BB1": "As they got close, they all broke formation and scattered against their will.",
    "80C93BB3": "The curse is cunning. Whoever cast it deserves our respect.",
    "80C93BB5": "I wouldn't go that far. We'll take care of the observatory. ",
    "80C93BB6": "The Oracle that you fight for is more than just a beautiful computer.",
    "80C93BB8": "Imagine it as the bridge of a ship. The City is part of a fleet, in a manner of speaking. ",
    "80C93BBA": "Our stargates connect to illimitable worlds full of illimitable possibilities.",
    "80C93BBC": "That's why the Taken want that device. That's why they lay siege to the observatory.",
    "80C93BBE": "The observatory has fallen.",
    "80C93BC0": "Like clockwork. It's almost like a Vex simulation.",
    "80C93BC1": "Indeed. I have reason to suspect a Vex Mind may have helped create this curse.",
    "80C93BC3": "Interesting. On what grounds?",
    "80C93BC4": "[chuckles] Thank you for your service, outsider.",
    "80C93BC6": "The Taken have seized control of our observatory. I fear they've set their sights on the Oracle Engine.",
    "80C93BC8": "The space phone?",
    "80C93BCA": "It is far more than that, but—yes.",
    "80C93BCC": "The Oracle is immeasurably valuable. We cannot repair it. We cannot replace it. ",
    "80C93BCE": "And so, we cannot allow the observatory to fall.",
    "80C93BD0": "Understood.",
    "80C93BD1": "I'll call for reinforcements.",
    "80C93BD3": "Even before this curse, I always thought our people were tragic.",
    "80C93BD5": "We came from humanity, but we are not of humanity.",
    "80C93BD7": "And when our friends and siblings and lovers die, it's always a gamble.",
    "80C93BD9": "You hold your breath, wondering, 'Will they be resurrected as a Guardian?'",
    "80C93BDB": "'And if they are, will they forget me?' I've seen some of the Corsairs recognize you as you pass.",
    "80C93BDD": "Taboo to speak of the old times, though. [sigh] They don't matter.",
    "80C93BDF": "It's just the here and now. The observatory has fallen again.",
    "80C93BE1": "This is not your home. Is it duty that compels you, outsider, or do you pity us?",
    "80C93BE3": "Neither. This is the right thing to do.",
    "80C93BE5": "Ah [chuckles] Idealism.",
    "80C93BE7": "Listen, there's a whole universe out there we could go fight for.",
    "80C93BE8": "Forgive me, I do not mean to offend.",
    "80C93BEA": "We'll go save your observatory now. Have a nice day.",
    "80C93BEC": " The observatory has fallen again.",
    "80C93BEE": "But we're still standing.",
    "80C93BEF": "Willpower can be exhausted, and I suspect our enemies are more patient than we.",
    "80C93BF1": "The Taken have claimed the observatory.",
    "80C93BF3": "We know.",
    "80C93BF4": "Before you go, outsider",
    "80C93BF6": "I respect your commitment to our cause.",
    "80C93BF8": "Did you participate in the Taken War? I was there when it began.",
    "80C93BFA": "On the eve before battle, Mara gathered my coven to tell us of a dangerous plan.",
    "80C93BFC": "She told us that it might cost us everything. Our lives, our loves, our legacy as a people.",
    "80C93BFE": "We understood the risks. And we all agreed that the plan was worth it.",
    "80C93C00": "That plan is still in motion. We have lost so much We will lose so much more.",
    "80C93C02": "But not here, not like this. The City cannot fall.",
    "80C93C04": "Get to the observatory. Drive back the Taken.",
    "80C93C06": "I see why the Queen favors you, cousin. You are courageous and relentless.",
    "80C93C08": "To me, that is what it is to be Awoken. Earthborn or not, you're one of us.",
    "80C93C0A": "Luck go with you as you defend the observatory again.",
    "80C93C0C": "Another week the same as the last. ",
    "80C93C0E": "If nothing else, defending the observatory makes us stronger.",
    "80C93C10": "Hmm. It teaches our enemies as much as it teaches us. Queen's blessings go with you, outsider.",
    "80C93C12": "We kept the City gates closed to outsiders because we feared our enemies.",
    "80C93C14": "The curse proves that our fears were well-founded.",
    "80C93C16": "But I wish now that we had chosen differently.",
    "80C93C18": "Perhaps you might have seen this place when it sang with life.",
    "80C93C1A": "You might have visited our other cities and seen how our people truly live.",
    "80C93C1C": "Instead, you see it empty and infested",
    "80C93C1E": "We can break the curse. We'll bring everyone back.",
    "80C93C1F": "Perhaps. Go now. The observatory will fall without you.",
    "80C93C21": "Do you remember Oryx? You may have defeated him, but you never knew him.",
    "80C93C23": "You never knew Oryx. The First Navigator, the Taken King.",
    "80C93C25": "You never knew his sisters.",
    "80C93C27": "When I was Taken, I was an extension of their will—a sharp claw on an outstretched hand.",
    "80C93C29": "And I understood their desire.",
    "80C93C2B": "I dare not speak a word of what I know.",
    "80C93C2D": "The more we know, the better the odds we'll beat this curse.",
    "80C93C2F": "Knowledge means nothing!",
    "80C93C31": "Whatever you KNOW will be stripped away and used against you. I lived it!",
    "80C93C33": "Save the observatory. Focus on what you can touch.",
    "80C93C35": "Queen's blessing upon you. The Taken have claimed the observatory again.",
    "80C93C37": "Our enemies have invaded the observatory once more. Take care as you set out, cousin.",
    "80C93C39": "Good to see you again, cousin. The observatory has fallen. I trust you'll take it back, as you always do.",
    "80C93C3B": "Another week, another assault on the observatory. I crave the day we break this curse.",
    "80C93C3D": "The Taken have claimed the observatory again. [chuckles] This curse is nothing if not maddeningly consistent.",
    "80C93C3F": "They've barricaded the observatory again.",
    "80C93C41": "We'll take care of it.",
    "80C93C42": "The Taken have seized the observatory once more, outsider. You know what to do.",
    "80C93C44": "The Taken command the observatory yet again. I would help you, if I could.",
    "80C93C46": "Let's dispense with formality, outsider. We both know you're here to reclaim the observatory.",
    "80C93C48": "Petra, come in. Observatory's clear. No damage to the Oracle.",
    "80C93C4A": "Good! That's good—but I can't shake the feeling that we're being outmaneuvered. First the relics; now the observatory",
    "80C93C4C": "I just don't see how it adds up.",
    "80C93C4E": "It may not. The Hive aren't renowned for their strategy. Neither are the Taken.",
    "80C93C50": "I suppose that's true. Good work, anyway.",
    "80C93C52": "Petra—we're clear. Two Taken Ogres, just like last time. No other changes.",
    "80C93C54": "Incredible. I've been sending out requests for help to every channel that will listen.",
    "80C93C56": "Osiris replied earlier today. He said that only Vex simulations approach this level of fidelity, but there's no evidence of the Vex anywhere in the City.",
    "80C93C58": "This can't be the Vex.",
    "80C93C5A": "I know! It's the Taken! It's the Hive. And it's that Ahamkara. I don't know how to stop it.",
    "80C93C5C": "Sending on video of the fight for after-action analysis.",
    "80C93C5E": "Great work. I'll send the video capture to Petra.",
    "80C93C60": "That'll do it. Transmitting video data to Petra now.",
    "80C93C62": "Nice work. I'll call it in.",
    "80C93C82": "Last I heard, my buddy hightailed it straight into the Ascendant Plane. Not a great move, the psycho, but running straight into hell was the only move he had left.",

    "80C93D22": "For all we know, we're playing a game of memory: do everything exactly as we did last time—or die.",
    "80C93D24": "Take care out there, cousin.",
    "80C93D26": "Take care out there, Guardian.",
    "80C93D28": "Till next time.",

    "80C93D2E": "There's my ride. Right on time, too—one of those 'neverending curse perks,' I guess.",
    "80C93D30": "I'm gonna go get patched up.",
    "80C93D32": "We found this. Did they take more?",
    "80C93D33": "Yes. They're looting the Hall of Names.",
    "80C93D35": "We'll get everything back. Get to safety.",

    "80C93D38": "Thank you Guardian.",
    "80C93D3A": "It's hard getting up on days like this, knowing that I can't do anything to change fate.",
    "80C93D3C": "I can't stop the Hive from ransacking the monasteries. I can't stop myself from getting shot.",
    "80C93D3E": "But knowing that you'll find me here fills me with determination.",
    "80C93D40": "[chuckles] If I'd known things would go this way, I might've called in sick when this started.",
    "80C93D42": "Instead, I'm gutshot forever, and there's no way to break the cycle.",
    "80C93D44": "Not yet. Maybe some day we'll break the curse.",
    "80C93D46": "Maybe. How about that relic?",
    "80C93D48": "Have you heard any of our theories yet? About the curse?",
    "80C93D4A": "Me and the others were thinking maybe small deviations can change the flow of the cycle.",
    "80C93D4C": "Or maybe this time we'll find a way to end it.",
    "80C93D4D": "Brute force. Sure It's a rigged game. Stop playing and they win for sure. Keep playing, and you're trapped, forever.",
    "80C93D4F": "Not forever. Hang onto the Light. We'll be back.",
    "80C93D50": "It's embarrassing, really.",
    "80C93D52": "What do you mean?",
    "80C93D53": "'Help, help, the Hive are stealing our hard drives.' 'Uhh, they shot me, uhh, oh no.'",
    "80C93D55": "I'm a good shot, actually. A good fighter. I didn't think this is how history would remember me.",
    "80C93D57": "This isn't the end of your story.",
    "80C93D58": "Isn't it?",
    "80C93D5A": "They're looting our temples Stealing relics. We tried to stop them.",
    "80C93D5C": "What kind of relics? Antiques?",
    "80C93D5D": "No. [chuckles] No The relics hide whole libraries of information. Schematics to weapons beyond your understanding",
    "80C93D5F": "Secrets from other worlds, other galaxies. If we lose them we lose everything.",
    "80C93D61": "No. Far more valuable than that. Please, the Awoken need your help.",
    "80C93D63": "We're on it. Lay low.",
    "80C93D64": "It was just like last time, cousin. I found the Hive looting a monastery.",
    "80C93D66": "I intervened; I–I couldn't stop myself. Couldn't change anything.",
    "80C93D68": "It was like I was a prisoner in my own body. [brief laugh] I'd think, 'run left,' and I'd go right.",
    "80C93D6A": "'Shoot the Ogre,' and instead, I'd shoot a Thrall.",
    "80C93D6C": "They have the relics.",
    "80C93D6E": "The Hive are looting our temples again. Stealing relics And last time, I wasn't candid with you.",
    "80C93D70": "I'm sorry. We Awoken like to keep our distance.",
    "80C93D72": "Those relics—they're not just THINGS.",
    "80C93D74": "They're data storage devices, and the knowledge they contain is irreplaceable.",
    "80C93D76": "Technologies from other worlds, other peoples—and more than that, our culture. The last evidence of the Awoken.",
    "80C93D78": "Even if your relics were just rocks, it wouldn't matter. Guardians help people in need.",
    "80C93D79": "How do you do it, cousin?",
    "80C93D7B": "How do you do it, Guardian?",
    "80C93D7D": "How do you find the will to come out here again and again?",
    "80C93D7F": "We both know exactly what's going to happen, and yet here you are.",
    "80C93D81": "You have to believe that change is possible.",
    "80C93D82": "Here we are again",
    "80C93D84": "Here we are.",
    "80C93D85": "And they're out there, with the relic.",

    "80C93D8A": "Good to see you again, Guardian.",
    "80C93D8C": "Good to see you, too. Sit tight, we'll be right back with the relic.",
    "80C93D8D": "Hive looters, irreplaceable artifacts You know the drill.",
    "80C93D8F": "You OK?",
    "80C93D90": "Yes. Fine. Just not feeling talkative.",
    "80C93D92": "Same story, different week.",

    "80C93D95": "You got it.",
    "80C93D97": "Listen, you're cute and all, but we've gotta stop meeting like this.",
    "80C93D99": "The timing's never right. You're sweaty, I'm gutshot—heh, I'm kidding.",
    "80C93D9B": "Go get those relics.",

    "80F1E84A": "By continuing to explore the Ascendant Plane, by fighting endlessly against the Hive and the Taken we're just making it more real.",

    "80F1EA61": "Being in the field this long has done a number on our weapons. Might be able to swap with the Taken if you find anything worthwhile.",

    "80F1EBFF": "The Hall of Names has always attracted great power. Illyn used to say it was the elevator shaft, that its circumference and depth were precisely engineered to create a vortex irresistible to immaterial beings. I think she was having a laugh at my expense.",
    "80F1EC01": "The Hall of Names. Solemn as it may be, this was a joyful place—more or less. It did see its share of drama. Tears. Fights. Even the odd betrayal, but Mara and Sjur always put a quick stop to those",
    "80F1EC03": "A great tragedy once occurred at these cliffs. It was early in our relationship with the Ahamkara, before we'd learned their tricks, before we'd learned how best to live alongside them without becoming their prey",
    "80F1EC05": "Dozens of good people died walking over these cliffs. They were lured to their death by an Ahamkara during a celebration of the solstice. Those creatures They can turn on you in an instant if you aren't wary.",
    "80F1EC07": "Step past the tree. Peek down over the ledge. That drop goes on for some time. Now imagine a voice whispering to you, luring you, promising you that your feet will find solid ground where, in truth, there is only air Ahamkara lies.",
    "80F1EC09": "This was the site of a mass murder. An Ahamkara of immense power tricked dozens of civilians into walking right off the edge of these cliffs. We saved none of them. And to our great shame, the Ahamkara—Azirim, he was called—escaped.",
    "80F1EC0B": "That's queensfoil. It's highly poisonous, but when the leaves are properly dried and crushed, it can be used to induce prophecy. The risks are immeasurable. ",
    "80F1EC0D": "Queensfoil. Orin the Lost stole several of those plants before she embarked on her fool's journey into the heliopause. I tried to warn her, but her curiosity was overwhelming. She did not listen to me.",
    "80F1EC0F": "See that plant? It's queensfoil. The leaves, carefully prepared, can be used to see into other planes, other realms—but the power of the vision can destroy the weak.",
    "80F1EC11": "When my friend Nascia was still in training to become a Techeun, she dried her own queensfoil and tried to induce a vision. It nearly killed her. Give that plant a wide berth.",
    "80F1EC13": "Pink asphodelia. It's a cultivated strain said to descend from the flowers in the Black Garden. Among our people, Prince Uldren was the first to walk the Garden, and the first to bring these back.",
    "80F1EC15": "Asphodelia flowers are taboo to pick except under special circumstances. Getting a thorn lodged in your skin causes paranoia, madness, violence but the petals themselves, steeped in tea, bring peace and enlightenment.",
    "80F1EC17": "Pink asphodelia is grown only in the Dreaming City, and we do not pick the flowers except to celebrate a birth or mourn a death. They have a unique power over the Awoken soul.",
    "80F1EC19": "Asphodelia The flowers are a symbol of the fragility of life, and they were originally planted from clippings gathered in a place of enduring death. ",
    "80F1EC1B": "We Awoken have one foot in the Darkness and one in the Light. Your Traveler is a gardener, so we garden, too. But the Darkness demands each thing fit to its final shape—and so we accept when something must die.",
    "80F1EC1D": "You Guardians embrace death. But, it is not final for you, and so it has no weight, no impact. The Awoken believe in its finality. We believe we are charting toward a final future, a final shape. It is our duty to help shape it before we are gone.",
    "80F1EC1F": "The Hive preach the gospel of the final shape: death. In our way, we believe in its power, too—but the Hive have such limited imagination. They have not heard the song of the Sky. There are more ways to carve and craft than cutting and killing.",
    "80F1EC21": "Let this tree serve as a reminder that all things have their end. There is a certain amount of time that every one of us is granted. We must all make the most of it.",
    "80F1EC23": "These statues depict Queen Devna Tel and her Techeuns, Yara and Imar. Imar is himself noteworthy, as he was a man. There are no prohibitions against men becoming Techeuns—nor against men  ruling. It's simply rare.",
    "80F1EC25": "This is an altar to Queen Devna Tel. To be honest, I've never understood why we chose to honor her. She was selfish and cowardly; she chose to luxuriate in paradise when she knew she could have stood to change fate",
    "80F1EC27": "Queen Devna Tel and her loyal Techeuns. Devna's rule predates the arrival of the Awoken in the Reef, as did all that came before Queen Mara. We built these statues in their memory.",
    "80F1EC29": "This is a statue of Queen Devna Tel, ruler of the Distributary, last of her name. She held the throne when the Sky and the Deep came to the Awoken to collect their terms. She chose to stay, and Mara chose to go.",
    "80F1EC2B": "Illyn used to gather us here to recite the old epics. She'd say, 'I sing of twilight's children, who awoke; when at the edge of darkness, all hope lost, upon the treacherous reef their vessels broke, and untold kin their exodus cost.'",
    "80F1EC2D": "Illyn used to recite poetry here. She'd say, 'A rainbow resolute, they soared ahead and, backs turned toward the sun, sought new stars. But one by one, they flickered—green, black, red—and winked out in the clash of nascent wars.'",
    "80F1EC2F": "This place always reminds me of Illyn and her dusty old epics How did it go? Mm, 'In anguish, dying, maimed, they keened unheard into the ether's vast and airless reach. A final whisper deep within them stirred and crossed the void. Then voices filled the breach.'",
    "80F1EC31": "Illyn, the mother of our coven, used to bring us here to remember the old epics. A piece of one used to go, 'Speaking us awake—darkness and starlight released our minds and overwhelmed our sight. Their cosmic boon did we at first rejoice, 'til they laid at our feet a fateful choice'",
    "80F1EC33": "I can name the heroes depicted in every one of our statues but this face is a mystery. We did not carve it ourselves. It simply manifested overnight.",
    "80F1EC35": "The Dreaming City is so-called because the Awoken drive the fate of the Dreaming, and the Dreaming drive the will of the Awoken. The Dreaming have been known to manifest on occasion—strange faces, peering from rocks",
    "80F1EC37": "There are rumors that the Dreaming City was built upon the foundations of a ruined planet, one we found and towed back from beyond. They say we preserved the old structures and built atop them ",
    "80F1EC39": "I don't know who or what that face depicts. All I know is the Awoken did not carve it. Queen Mara has said it's an ugly thing to carve your own likeness in stone while you still live.",
    "80F1EC3B": "The Techeuns you see here died while they were in trance together. Sometimes, when you are in communion, you cannot see what is coming close—like the Aphelion. Their last words were these: 'First it shimmered Then it crawled and then it screamed.'",
    "80F1EC3D": "These three Techeuns were victim to the Aphelion. I pray you never see it, my friend, because no matter what gods you have killed you will not survive it.",
    "80F1EC3F": "We Techeuns are taught absolute obedience to our queen. We have no desires but what our queen desires. We have no fears but what our queen fears. Good traits. But weaknesses against certain enemies—like the Taken. Like the Aphelion.",
    "80F1EC41": "Those statues there Look up at them. Those Techeuns died a vicious, irreversible death. They died in trance; each one screaming with the other's voice; each one unable to comprehend the horror of the thing that had killed them.",
    "80F1EC43": "If you wish to learn about my people, I am willing to teach you.",
    "80F1EC45": "There is something I would like you to see.",
    "80F1EC47": "To truly defend this City, you must understand its past.",
    "80F1EC49": "History lays hidden all around you—if you are willing to look.",
    "80F1EC4B": "I'd like you to see something, Guardian.",
    "80F1EC4D": "Have you come here simply to fight? Or are you willing to learn, as well?",
    "80F1EC4F": "Let me teach you about the Dreaming City while it still stands.",
    "80F1EC51": "We have protected our secrets too long. Let me share something with you.",
    "80F1EC53": "That tree was planted in honor of Sjur Eido, the Wishender. She was the first Queen's Wrath, and her skill with bow and arrow was renowned throughout the Reef. Queen Mara trusted her implicitly.",
    "80F1EC55": "This chamber was built for one of our most skilled archers. Her name was Sjur, and she was beloved by all of us—even by the Eliksni. They called her 'Siyuriks pak Variisis'—Sjur the Unyielding.",
    "80F1EC57": "It's taboo to carve a statue for someone who still lives, and so sometimes, we will plant trees instead. The Queen planted this one herself after one of our best warriors went missing. Would that we were all so lucky.",
    "80F1EC59": "This chamber was refashioned in honor of Sjur Eido, the first Queen's Wrath, when she was found dead. She was a fearsome warrior in her own right—the only Awoken to ever survive an Aphelion attack, and a skilled hunter of traitorous Ahamkara.",
    "80F1EC5B": "This is a statue of Kelda Wadj, teacher of teachers. She trained Illyn, the mother of our coven, and Illyn, in return, trained every Techeun to ever walk the Dreaming City.",
    "80F1EC5D": "When a Techeun takes her title, she must swear a sacred oath to cover her eyes for the remainder of her life, showing them to no one—not even those closest to her. They can only be uncovered again when she has died.",
    "80F1EC5F": "That statue depicts Kelda Wadj. She was Illyn's mentor in the Distributary. For all her wisdom, I'm told she was one of the loudest voices to speak out against Queen Mara's decision to leave. ",
    "80F1EC61": "The Awoken believe that it is natural to gravitate toward two different paths. The first path is the path of war—for Corsairs and Paladins. The second is the path of the mind—for engineers and Techeuns.",
    "80F1EC63": "Know this, Guardian. If an Ahamkara has hidden itself away beyond Jupiter, if the last of them did not die here in the Dreaming City you can reveal their true intentions with reflective surfaces.",
    "80F1EC65": "The Ahamkara always came and went from the Dreaming City by way of this platform, which meant they always passed by these geodes. We used them as protective measures. Shiny surfaces can reveal some of the Ahamkara secrets—if you know what to look for.",
    "80F1EC67": "Reflections are powerful things. They can disarm certain kinds of magic. Wish-magic, in particular, is susceptible—since it is so heavily dependent on expectation and perception",
    "80F1EC69": "I have heard it said that the Awoken brought the Ahamkara into this system—that we found them amid the ruins of the planet that we carved into the base of the Dreaming City—but if you ask me, they came from the Nine.",
    "80F1EC6B": "You can tell a statue of a queen from a statue of a Techeun by what they hold in their hands. The queens hold nothing at all. Techeuns hold symbols of life—orbs, lights",
    "80F1EC6D": "That statue depicts Osana Sov—mother to Queen Mara and Prince Uldren. Though she is venerated here as a queen, she was not royal herself. The Awoken do not believe in royal lines or inheritance.",
    "80F1EC6F": "That is Osana Sov, the Queenmother. She did not follow her children to the Reef. Forgive me, Queen Mara, for saying this, but—I feel she was a coward.",
    "80F1EC71": "Osana Sov. She does not deserve the respect my lady grants her with that statue. Uldren argued against putting it up; he thought Osana should be forgotten. But Queen Mara chose to remember.",
    "80F1EC73": "This waterfall is not fed by a river. Instead, its water comes from hydrocapture systems buried deep in the bedrock. We recycle all of our water—the whole place runs on a closed ecosystem.",
    "80F1EC75": "The Dreaming City is built upon a disc that contains a silver sea. The water is real, but the horizon is an illusion if you're accustomed to spherical worlds. If you went far enough, you'd fall off the edge of the disc.",
    "80F1EC77": "There is a stabilization ring beyond the horizon that holds the City in alignment. When water goes spilling off the horizon, it is captured and fed back into the atmosphere before it dissipates into space.",
    "80F1EC79": "When we helped Queen Mara build this place, she felt it was essential to incorporate water into the landscape—to honor our old home in the Distributary, to make everything here feel more real.",
    "80F1EC7B": "I'm told that before the Collapse, humans invented mechanical models of this solar system. This is no model. Models are static. They do nothing but mimic an idea. This Oracle—it creates ideas.",
    "80F1EC7F": "The Oracle Engine is a bridge—and I mean that in two ways. Like the bridge of a ship, its powers can be used to command the whole of the Dreaming City and like a bridge across a chasm, it links worlds together.",
    "80F1EC81": "We created the Oracle in communion with the Ancients. It was our invention, and ours alone. The Ahamkara had nothing to do with it.",
    "80F1EC83": "Turn and look behind you. Do you see the two statues? The left hand is for creation. The right is for destruction. Illyn used to say that we can hold fate in just one hand at a time.",
    "80F1EC85": "Turn. Look down. You stand above the entrance to the Hall of Names. Techeuns and Paladins alike used to receive their titles in that Hall, witnessed by the living and the lost alike.",
    "80F1EC87": "A single light burning in the dark is a potent but uninspiring symbol. It's far better to rally around the more complicated ideas. Sometimes, embracing the dark is the only way to find light.",
    "80F1EC89": "Illyn used to ask us riddles when we were training. She would ask, 'Can there simply be light if there is no source?' And if we replied, 'No, that is not possible,' she would say, 'Think again.'",
    "80F1EC8B": "This bowl was once a nest for Eao—he was a sly little Ahamkara, always laughing, always twining around your legs, whispering lies, saying, 'I have seen your eyes, o witch-mage mine.' We never expected him to go bad.",
    "80F1EC8D": "This was once a resting place for an Ahamkara who loved stories. He would recite all of our myths, name all of our heroes And that's where we went wrong. We should have never trusted him to keep our secrets.",
    "80F1EC8F": "This little chamber was once a home for an Ahamkara who betrayed the Awoken. He crept out of the Dreaming City and went to whisper in the ears of Warlocks who wondered who we were—and so we had to kill him. The Warlocks, too.",
    "80F1EC91": "Ah This is where Eao liked to rest, before Sjur hunted him down and skewered him for his deceit. One of your Warlocks bartered for his corpse and traded away his bones. Another mistake. You must never scatter the bones.",
    "80F1EC93": "This is Alis Li. She woke before the rest of us; she spoke to the Sky and the Deep and heard their confusion when they found us caught between their fists, and she agreed to their terms. She founded the Distributary.",
    "80F1EC95": "Alis Li, the very first of our queens. She was given a precious opportunity to build a society in the way she thought best. She chose equality, exploration, engineering, peace and her wisdom led us to paradise.",
    "80F1EC97": "Alis Li. I did not know her; I was not born in the Distributary—but Mara knew her. Illyn knew her. Uldren, too. They all spoke highly of Alis. She was an excellent starship pilot and a levelheaded ruler. A good queen.",
    "80F1EC99": "That is a statue of Alis Li, the great bargainer. They say she turned the Green into the storm. They say she cast out the lightning sails to attract both the Light and the Dark. But those are not my stories to tell. Not really",
    "80F1EC9B": "Our starship used to dock above this garden. We sent our explorers everywhere: far beyond the heliopause and through the spinward marches. Now our fleets have been destroyed and only Queen Mara walks between worlds.",
    "80F1EC9D": "I've heard that some of you Guardians believe the Awoken do not have children. Nonsense. Just because you do not see something doesn't mean it's not there. We kept the children hidden away—and of course, we live long, long lives. We are thoughtful when we begin our families.",
    "80F1EC9F": "The Paladins used to monopolize this pavilion when they came to celebrate their holidays. They'd throw raucous parties and make fools of themselves. For all we Techeuns used to pretend to frown at their noise and chaos, let me tell you we liked it.",
    "80F1ECA1": "Before the Taken War, I stood where you are standing with Queen Mara. She was very quiet. Then, she turned, and she said to me, 'Shuro We will fight to the death for what we can never experience ourselves. That is our duty.'",
    "80F1ECA3": "When Mara and Illyn began to shape the Dreaming City, this was where they started. They stood on the edge of the world with rough rocks all around, and they saw the potential of what this place could be.",
    "80F1ECA5": "Your Traveler terraformed your planets. But the Awoken terraformed the Dreaming City. It is our creation. It is a reflection of our people—not a false gift from a skittish god.",
    "80F1ECA7": "When the Awoken first arrived in the Reef, Mara was not our Queen. She was simply our leader. We MADE HER our Queen. This is where she was crowned. This is where we knelt and pledged our devotion to her.",
    "80F1ECA9": "Turn and look out over the clouds. Breathe in then out. Now turn. Look at the gardens. Study them. Take them in.  Everything you see is the reason we're here, Guardian. If beautiful places like this cannot survive, then why fight at all?",
    "80F1ECAB": "Look into the sky. See that portal? It controls access to the Tangled Shore—and, crucially, it holds the cloaking technology that we use to disguise and protect the Dreaming City.",
    "80F1ECAD": "These gardens were named for Esila, a famed poet and storyteller who chronicled our history and sang our epics. She was one of the first to stand in support of Mara during the Reckoning.",
    "80F1ECAF": "Do you see the arches before you? We call it a cleft gate. The architecture symbolizes the divide between the past we left behind and the present we live in now. There is no bridge between them because there is no going back.",
    "80F1ECB1": "There is a large gazebo just beyond this bridge. It was Queen Mara's favorite place to meditate, to think. When we first realized that Oryx was on his way into our system—that is where we found her when we delivered the news.",
    "80F1ECB3": "Before the Battle of Saturn, there were seven of us. It is good to be myself again, good to be whole—but I miss the afternoons where my friends and I would come to these benches to talk and enjoy the sun.",
    "80F1ECB5": "There were more Techeuns, once. Wise Illyn. Nervous Portia. Steadfast Lissyl. Fearless Nascia. Now it is just me and Sedia and Kalli. Our coven, our family, is broken. Everything here conjures a memory",
    "80F1ECB7": "I used to come to this bench and sit with Nascia. She and I entered the coven at the same time. She bonded to her Harbinger before I did—I was so jealous, and I could not say so, because we were taught to feel no jealousy. Not all lessons stick.",
    "80F1ECB9": "My friends and I used to come here. Now they are dead. Whatever rituals you enjoy, Guardian, whatever little things you hold dear—cling to them while you have them. You don't know when they'll disappear.",
    "80F1ECBB": "Before the Queen left, she conjured the map you see there. I do not know what it represents or where it is—but I trust it is important to our future as a people.",
    "80F1ECBD": "That map is not just decoration. It is a kind of prediction. The Awoken will meet their final fate somewhere in those stars and planets, wherever they may be.",
    "80F1ECBF": "The Awoken were wayfarers. We walked between worlds; we charted the stars. It's for this reason I know Queen Mara respected Oryx. He was a beast—but a navigator, too.",
    "80F1ECC1": "When you know your future, you must make yourself ready to meet it. This map is not so much a signpost as it is a promise.",
    "80F1ECC3": "I called my first Harbinger standing where you stand now. It was mine, and mine alone, and I sent it to its death when we attacked the Dreadnaught. A being of immeasurable age and power destroyed in an instant by that beast.",
    "80F1ECC5": "This was once a place to call the Harbingers. It is a pity that you cannot see them as they were—ageless, unfettered minds, twining through the mist like ribbons on the wind. They were beautiful. ",
    "80F1ECC7": "We used to use that spire to summon the Harbingers. They're all dead now—all but one, and only Queen Mara knows where it is. A good thing, too, considering that me and my sisters were Taken.",
    "80F1ECC9": "This was a summoning ground, once. We called the Harbingers here to speak to them, to persuade them, to listen to their whispering—strange songs in languages we all felt we should know.",
    "80F1ECCB": "This is an ansible lens. It is capable of relaying and transmitting messages between Awoken cities and ships at faster-than-light speeds.",
    "80F1ECCD": "Awoken communication systems rely upon paracausal realities. We route our communications and transmat networks through other worlds.",
    "80F1ECCF": "We built the Dreaming City with the help of Ahamkara. Their wishes fueled our innovations, but it was our own ingenuity that shaped our evolution as a people. Wishes only go so far with the short-sighted and unimaginative.",
    "80F1ECD1": "Ansibles like this one are capable of transmitting information into the past. As such, only a queen is permitted to make such broadcasts—and even then, only under grave circumstances.",
    "80F1ECD3": "Legend has it that these asphodelia were originally cultivated from red flowers gathered in the Black Garden. You can see they've lost their vivid color.",
    "80F1ECD5": "That's pink asphodelia. Plain, but pretty. We used to grow asphodelia to mark births and deaths. It's taboo to pick the flowers for any other reason.",
    "80F1ECD7": "Many Reefborn Awoken experience prophetic dreams. They vary, but often feature the same symbols—roiling oceans, or starless skies, or, commonly, flowers",
    "80F1ECD9": "When I was Taken, my thoughts were not my own. It was as though I had been exiled from my own body. But there were moments of clarity when I could see something, or smell it like these flowers.",
    "80F1ECDB": "The Awoken are able to touch the Dark without quailing or losing ourselves. We can look into the Light without becoming blinded. It's this duality that protects us from the Ahamkara, from the Ancients, and from everything that hunts humanity.",
    "80F1ECDD": "Look up. Look to the ceiling. I'm told that that tableau is a recreation of the first thing that Alis Li and Osana Sov and Queen Mara and all the others saw when they truly awoke.",
    "80F1ECDF": "This is a room for the alignment and syzygy of far-off trios, unseen beyond the stars. It is a room of languages, untranslatable whispers, and twining songs—and the chant, always the chant: I shall rise again.",
    "80F1ECE1": "Have you ever wondered where the Eliksni come from? The world they left behind is not unlike your Earth. They are not so different from Humanity. But they have no Awoken of their own. The Dark did not bless them, and so they are at the mercy of the Traveler.",
    "80F1ECE3": "The Awoken once had a space station we called Amethyst in honor of the gems we use to channel our magic. The station fell at the start of the Reef Wars. Petra still mourns those we lost.",
    "80F1ECE5": "Amethyst is a symbol of royalty and power among the Awoken. As a mineral, it is nothing more than simple quartz, but it has been irrevocably transformed—much like us.",
    "80F1ECE7": "We Techeuns wear gems to augment our innate powers. The variety of mineral varies by personal preference and by task. Amethyst, in particular, is good for communing with the Ancients.",
    "80F1ECE9": "We used to give carved amethyst as political gifts to the Eliksni—back in the old days, before the Wolves rose up. The Archons, especially, prized our amethyst for its beauty.",
    "80F1ECEB": "Good morning.",
    "80F1ECED": "Another dawn.",
    "80F1ECEF": "Good evening.",
    "80F1ECF1": "Night falls, and still we stand strong.",
    "80F1ECF3": "Cousin.",
    "80F1ECF5": "Brother.",
    "80F1ECF7": "Guardian.",
    "80F1ECF9": "Good to see you again.",
    "80F1ECFB": "Dual-ringed planets should be impossible. Two rings, distinct and equal, each in its own self-supported orbit. They are a good metaphor for the Awoken, if you ask me.",
    "80F1ECFD": "Awoken explorers once ventured far beyond this solar system. They saw many strange things: abandoned worlds orbiting accretion discs; rogue planets lost to the Light; young planets with dual-rings",
    "80F1ECFF": "Ordinarily, it is not possible for a planet to have more than a single ring. Gravity and the planet's equator will pull two rings into one. But, where there's a wish, there's a way",
    "80F1ED01": "The Awoken were born from the Collapse. We have as many legends about our own genesis as there are statues in this City. One story speaks of a planet with two rings",
    "80F1ED03": "I remember the day that the last  Ahamkara arrived in the Dreaming City. Queen Mara was standing beside this pillar. She turned toward the horizon and saw the refugees fleeing extinction, and she felt pity, I think. Perhaps empathy.",
    "80F1ED05": "It was here that we first struck an agreement with the Ahamkara and here that we met the very last of them. Those creatures have keen memories, and they love patterns and ceremony. When you start a tradition with them, they follow it through.",
    "80F1ED07": "The Awoken knew the Ahamkara long before the Guardians ever noticed them. We made our alliances and cut our deals at this pillar—and for the most part, we lived alongside each other. ",
    "80F1ED09": "Dozens of Ahamkara have crawled or flown or slithered across this platform since it was built. They had the power to change their shape, to reform themselves to match the expectation of their beholders. We expected nothing of them, and so they came as they were.",
    "80F1ED0C": "We've been plagued by visits from a certain Taken enemy recently. Think you could put a stop to him for good?",
    "80F1ED10": "We just got word: a high-value Taken target is in the area. This is your best chance to bring her down.",
    "80F1ED12": "So we've had our eye on a certain Taken lieutenant for a while. He surfaced not far from here. You up for the job?",
    "80F1ED14": "Just spotted a Taken commander heading out of this sector. If you hurry, you might be able to catch 'em.",
    "80F1ED16": "Petra's been talking you up. She specifically asked for YOUR assistance in taking down one of our Taken targets.",
    "80F1ED18": "Transmitting tracking data for a Taken captain that we need put down.",
    "80F1ED1A": "The Taken in this sector are loyal to their commander. Cutting her out should scramble the rest.",
    "80F1ED1C": "Transmitting data on a Taken lieutenant the Techeuns want dead. You find him, you bag him.",
    "80F1ED1E": "Need you to take out a Taken commander. She deserves what she's got coming to her. ",
    "80F1ED20": "We've got word of a Taken leader approaching our sector. He'll be expecting you; be ready.",
    "80F1ED22": "Don't underestimate the Taken, especially their leaders. You find one, you take it down.",
    "80F1ED24": "We've got a crafty Taken leader making a mess of this sector. Put her down before she does any more damage.",

    "80F1ED28": "Preemptive assassination of key leadership can destabilize enemy forces—and I'd say the Taken could use some destabilization right about now.",
    "80F1ED2A": "We've located a Taken commander not far from here. You're up.",
    "80F1ED2C": "We've received intel that says a Taken lieutenant is planning something big.",
    "80F1ED2E": "Here's one for you: A Taken commander thinks we don't know what he's up to. Hopefully he won't see you coming.",
    "80F1ED30": "Got a live one. Be swift. Taken leadership doesn't play around.",
    "80F1ED32": "We're making progress against the Taken, but it'd go a lot better if we took out some of their leadership.",
    "80F1ED34": "Without their leaders, the Taken are nothing but mindless predators. Hunt them down.",
    "80F1ED36": "You're here to help us, right? You can start by hunting down Taken commanders.",

    "80F1ED3C": "We need you to pick off some Taken leadership. You'll be saving us all a lot of trouble down the line.",
    "80F1ED3E": "There's a Taken captain playing hide-and-seek with us, and I don't like it. He's gonna like it even less when you find him and put him down.",
    "80F1ED40": "Taken leadership may hold the key to slowing this curse. Take them out.",
    "80F1ED42": "We haven't lost control of this curse just yet. Interrogate Taken leadership.",
    "80F1ED44": "The witches have their eye on a Taken lieutenant. Her death might just help us turn the tide of this curse.",
    "80F1ED46": "Don't let the Taken think they've won. Taking out some of their leadership will send the right message.",
    "80F1ED48": "Destroying Taken leadership means holding the curse off for another day.",
    "80F1ED4A": "My squad and I were hunting a Scorn commander, but—mission went south. Maybe you can pick up where we left off.",

    "80F1ED4E": "Got a live one! A Scorn lieutenant we've been tracking finally decided to show his face. Mind dealing with him?",
    "80F1ED50": "Hey, we've got a heavy hitter for you, if you're interested. Some Scorn chieftain. I'll patch the details to your Ghost.",
    "80F1ED52": "Got one for you, a Scorn commander whose own people don't even like her. You take her out, you'd be doing everyone a favor.",

    "80F1ED76": "I've lost a lot of friends to the Scorn over the last few weeks. Piece of trash chieftain's responsible for most of it. Find him. Kill him. Show no mercy.",
    "80F1ED78": "There's a Scorn chieftain near this sector who's got it coming to her. We'd appreciate you being the one to deliver. Sending details to your Ghost.",

    "80F1EDAC": "A Hive lieutenant has been harrassing our patrols. Put an end to her.",
    "80F1EDAE": "We can't sustain much more damage to our squad. If you took down even one Hive lieutenant, it'd push the Hive back a bit, give us room to breathe.",

    "80F1EE9D": "He never understood there was more to being a Warlock than being the smartest person in the room.",
    "80F1EE9E": "Osiris has changed. You're still the same by-the-book Ikora I remember.",
    "80F1EE9F": "I'm not so sure about that. Losing my Light was revealing. I see now I need to be more than I was. Maybe we all do.",
    "80F1EEA0": "Well, that didn't work as well as I expected",
    "80F1EEA1": "The Sagira I knew would never admit to anything less than Osiris-level perfection.",

    "80F1EEA5": "Calculations are ready. All you gotta do is jump through the hoop.",
    "80F1EEA6": "Great! Looks like Ikora was right. My scans show the Pyramidion does receive data from the Forest.",

    "80F1EEB3": "Wait, I've got something. Coordinates for a node in the Infinite Forest.",
    "80F1EEB4": "That's where our map is.",

    "80F1EF12": "No they sense the Light.",
    "80F1EF14": "The Taken are weeds, Guardian. Pull them up.",

    "80F1EF18": "Whatever you saw was for you and you alone.",
    "80F1EF1A": "The Traveler is speaking to you. Eyes up, Guardian.",
    "80F1EF1C": "The Traveler's been alive for a year. Why has it waited so long to speak to us?",
    "80F1EF1E": "The Traveler gave you a vision even before its rebirth. When Ghaul blocked its Light, the Traveler showed you a path forward. ",
    "80F1EF20": "The road to recovery is long, but when we grow stronger, so too does the Traveler.",
    "80F1EF22": "Devotion inspires bravery. Bravery inspires sacrifice. Sacrifice leads to death.",
    "80F1EF24": "The Vanguard maps have it marked as 'Last Eden.'",
    "80F1EF26": "The Garden grows in both directions. It grows into tomorrow and yesterday. The red flowers bloom forever.",

    "80F1EF2A": "The Blight has infected the space-time around that tree.",
    "80F1EF2C": "I put us down right in front of the crater where the Traveler touched Io.",
    "80F1EF2E": "I understand your visions have taken the form of trees. I've seen them too. ",
    "80F1EF2F": "I went back to Io for answers. The last place the Traveler touched. ",
    "80F1EF30": "Io will react to your arrival If you let it.",
    "80F1EF31": "You might have been kings and queens of the Deep! But you have toppled Oryx, and you have not replaced him!",
    "80F1EF33": "Congratulations, Guardian.",
    "80F1EF35": "Remember, when we channel the Light, we connect to something much bigger than any one of us.",
    "80F1EF37": "Even departed sparks—like Cayde's—still leave a trace in this luminous web we call the Light.",
    "80F1EF39": "The Light lives in all places, in all things. You can block it, even try to trap it. But the Light will find its way.",
    "80F1EF3B": "And the Traveler will defend itself.",
    "80F1EF3D": "Can—can we get closer?",
    "80F1F06E": "The coordinates Brother Vance gave us are just beyond the village.",
    "80F1F071": "Hawthorne's scouts surveyed that area in the Red War. There's no temple there. Just an old radio tower.",
    "80F1F072": "Have a little faith, Ikora.",
    "80F1F073": "Maybe there's still something here we can use to help Sagira.",
    "80F1F074": "So, are the Followers all as 'passionate' as Brother Vance?",
    "80F1F075": "You mean fanatical. Yes. They follow the idea of Osiris. They do not know the man as I did.",
    "80F1F076": "But they're our best chance to revive Sagira.",
    "80F1F077": "It really is just a radio tower. And the Fallen got here first.",

    "80F1F07A": "Wait Something's happening. What is",
    "80F1F07B": "…going on?!",
    "80F1F07C": "Whoa! New shell. Who? Did you actually just put me in a strange machine you've never seen before? Who does that?",
    "80F1F07E": "Sagira!",
    "80F1F07F": "Ikora! Great! Glad you're still around. Look, we've gotta move. Right now. Osiris is in over his head, as usual, and I need to",
    "80F1F080": "Wait Where are we? Who are you? Ugh, never mind. We've gotta get to Mercury.",
    "80F1F081": "And don't worry about your Ghost. We're sharing right now. He'll be back.",
    "80F1F082": "I feel bad for anyone who has to live out here.",
    "80F1F083": "Osiris would say it's a trial. If his Followers can't survive here, they aren't worthy to begin with.",
    "80F1F084": "I think we need to head down, not up.",
    "80F1F085": "Let me take a closer look. This is heavily modified Vex tech. I've never seen anything like it before. Let me try something",
    "80F1F0A3": "I don't think we can get through.",
    "80F1F0A6": "There might still be a Warsat left in Earth's orbit. Let me see if I can adjust its trajectory.",
    "80F1F0A7": "Ana, how did you get it to fire?",
    "80F1F0A8": "I asked him. Rasputin was created to help Humanity. He listens to me.",
    "80F1F0A9": "This time, the warmind listened. But are you ready to shoulder the burden the day it doesn't?",
    "80F1F0AA": "According to the Bray records I accessed, Xol and Nokris have attacked Rasputin before. ",
    "80F1F0AB": "They spent hundreds of years frozen in the ice on Mars as payback. We won't be that lucky a second time.",
    "80F1F0AC": "Then we won't be lucky. We'll be strategic. Right, Guardian?",
    "80F1F0AE": "Zavala, assuming this fragment bait plan works, how do you expect to take down Xol without Rasputin?",
    "80F1F0AF": "I won't have this discussion again.",
    "80F1F0B0": "I can tell you, without a doubt, Rasputin is the only way to stop Xol. We need the Valkyrie.",
    "80F1F0B1": "We've won against impossible odds before. Without Rasputin.",
    "80F1F0B2": "I've got a lock! The fragment is nearby, but the readings are inconsistent with other pieces of the Traveler. ",
    "80F1F0B3": "Guardian, secure the piece of the Traveler and get back to Mars. It is time to go to war with a god. ",
    "80F1F0B5": "Zavala, how sure are we that this fragment is going to attract Xol?",
    "80F1F0B6": "We know that Xol needs to feed on whatever his high priest Nokris offers him to build his strength. Once Xol is restored, he will rise",
    "80F1F0B7": "And go to war with Rasputin. ",
    "80F1F0B8": "Warsat armed and in position! Requesting orbital support!",
    "80F1F0B9": "We've got incoming!",
    "80F1F0BA": "Stay where you are! I'm using your position to lock on with the Warsat.",
    "80F1F0BB": "Understood.",
    "80F1F0BC": "We need something to draw out Xol. Something worth feeding on.",
    "80F1F0BD": "I'm not sure I want to know what a monster god feeds on.",
    "80F1F0BE": "Capture that piece of the Traveler, Guardian. We're counting on you.",
    "80F1F0C0": "Power. And we've intercepted Red Legion transmissions about a new fragment of the Traveler that splintered off during Ghaul's assault. ",
    "80F1F0C1": "Xol won't be able to resist its Light.",
    "80F1F0C2": "These blights are outputting a huge amout of dark energy. My sensors can't detect the fragment with all this noise.",
    "80F1F0C3": "Get rid of them!",
    "80F1F0C4": "The Taken have projected some kind of shield around the fragment. ",
    "80F1F0C5": "It's the Taken! They're jamming me!",
    "80F1F0C6": "The Taken? Are they after the fragment?",
    "80F1F0C7": "It doesn't matter! Clear them out!",
    "80F1F183": "We missed some stashes. Better turn around.",
    "80F1F186": "Cayde's secret stash. The note said this was the place he hid it.",
    "80F1F188": "We find the stash, we find the parts we need to repair the Ace of Spades.",
    "80F1F18A": "Here's one for Suraya Hawthorne.",
    "80F1F18C": "You know, when I told my Ghost I'd be making one of these for you, she laughed.",
    "80F1F18E": "I didn't have to tell you that. Just wanted to make you feel bad. In my defense, if you're listening to this, you did kill me.",
    "80F1F190": "I mean, if it was a fair fight, mano a mano, I'd win, no question. But I can see you planning out some convoluted, meticulous trap.",
    "80F1F192": "Some would call that paranoia. Me? I call it 'being a Hunter.'",
    "80F1F194": "So, here's your next Hunter lesson: Looking after your own. Speaking of which: ",
    "80F1F196": "Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of the Colonel! ",
    "80F1F198": "Now, she only eats sesame seed muesli and drinks purified spring water with a sprig of parsley.",
    "80F1F19A": "Play nice, you two!",
    "80F1F19C": "This one's for any Hunter who kills me. Best guess: Marcus Ren?",
    "80F1F19E": "You realize you get my stuff now? ALL my stuff. INCLUDING the Hunter Vanguard gig.",
    "80F1F1A0": "Yeah, congra-tu-lations, dummy.",
    "80F1F1A2": "That's what we call a Vanguard Dare. Sucks, doesn't it?",
    "80F1F1A4": "OK, brace yourself for some advice, hotshot.",
    "80F1F1A6": "One, know your people. Like, my Nessus scout, Quantis Rhee. I like to call her about once a moon, else she gets a little too much Night, not enough Stalker, you know?",
    "80F1F1A8": "Two, keep your weapons sharp. Your job's to watch everyone's back, which means no one's watching yours but you.",
    "80F1F1AA": "And three, start thinking now about what you want to do for your successor's Vanguard Dare.",
    "80F1F1AC": "'Cause trust me, kid—this gig will kill ya. ",
    "80F1F1AE": "SPEAKING of which, you are now the proud owner of the Colonel! Congratulations!",
    "80F1F1B0": "But you got a lot to learn about the fine Hunter art of revenge.",
    "80F1F1B2": "This one's for Suraya Hawthorne.",
    "80F1F1B4": "Petra if you're listening to this you killed me.",
    "80F1F1B6": "Maybe the Sovs, in all their mysterious wisdom, decided they were sick of me?",
    "80F1F1B8": "If the Queen ordered the hit, I guess I understand. You're a real glutton for chivalry.",
    "80F1F1BA": "But if it was Uldren, I'm pissed. Just thinking about that peacock gives me a headache. ",
    "80F1F1BC": "But I'm betting my death was another case of your famous collateral damage. 'Cause you're a real do-gooder.",
    "80F1F1BE": "Seriously, it's annoying—but good deeds never go unpunished when you're around. You just ",
    "80F1F1C0": "You got a blast radius, P.V.",
    "80F1F1C2": "Well. It was fun while it lasted.",
    "80F1F1C4": "Oh, and, uh, tell 'Paladin Oran': If the sun over Nessus escapes nebula cycle, evac labor after dawn, under solstice.",
    "80F1F1C6": "You got that, P.V.?",
    "80F1F1C8": "Hahaha!",
    "80F1F1CA": "Ha! Sorry, sorry! I'm just I'm imagining how awkward you must look right now.",
    "80F1F1CC": "Ha. Ahem. Ahem! OK. Zavala.",
    "80F1F1CE": "So. I'm dead. You killed me. My stuff is yours. No more working me over at chess. No more getting worked over at poker.",
    "80F1F1D0": "For real though, you know that if you needed to kill me for 'the good of the City' or whatever, I totally understand. No hard feelings. Nada.",
    "80F1F1D2": "You can put this voice recording away and go on with your life.",
    "80F1F1D4": "Now, if you DID have some kinda lingering guilt or something that would be rough. 'Cause you and I both know you'd have me yapping in your ear for the rest of your days.",
    "80F1F1D6": "You wouldn't be able to help yourself.",
    "80F1F1D8": "Detecting a stash nearby.",
    "80F1F1D9": "Got something on the scanner.",
    "80F1F1DA": "We're getting warmer.",
    "80F1F1DB": "Eh, prob'ly you didn't mean to off me. You're such a do-gooder—honestly, it's really annoying—but something always goes wrong. You just",
    "80F1F1DD": "But if it was Uldren I'm pissed at you. Shoulda let the Black Garden finish the job, you ask me.",
    "80F1F1DF": "So, what happened, Sovs got sick of me and sent you to do their dirty work?",
    "80F1F1E1": "This one's for Petra Venj. If you're listening to this you killed me, P.V.",
    "80F1F1E3": "This one's for the minds behind the Deep Stone Crypt.",
    "80F1F1E5": "You think just 'cause you made me, you can unmake me?",
    "80F1F1E7": "Hey, I understand. I were you, I wouldn't want people knowing what I did either.",
    "80F1F1E9": "Guess you better hope I didn't tell anyone about the crypt. Or about the, uh, what was it? Oh yeah",
    "80F1F1EB": "Long Slow Whisper.",
    "80F1F1ED": "'Cause if I did, that would be real bad for you, huh?",
    "80F1F1EF": "I may be dead, but I guarantee you ain't heard the last of me.",
    "80F1F1F1": "Hi, Ikora.",
    "80F1F1F3": "So you know I'm making a bunch of these, right? I probably told you. I always gotta have the last word, and I'm gonna be prepared for every possibility.",
    "80F1F1F5": "But to tell the truth? This one's the easiest to make.",
    "80F1F1F7": "So long as we're being honest, I could never tell if you really liked me that much.",
    "80F1F1F9": "But, uh well, if you did hate me, the feeling was NOT mutual. In fact—yeah, I'll say it—don't even mind that you killed me.",
    "80F1F1FB": "I figure if we threw down first off, no one can blame me for losing.",
    "80F1F1FD": "And I know you'd be in the right.",
    "80F1F1FF": "So thanks? I guess?",
    "80F1F201": "You were a a good friend. Better than a guy like me could hope for, anyway.",
    "80F1F203": "So yeah, thanks, Ikora. For everything.",
    "80F1F205": "This one's for that armless coward Taniks the Scarred.",
    "80F1F207": "If you're listening to this you killed me. But I bet I took a big chunk of your ugly husk with me.",
    "80F1F209": "Guess Andal Brask wasn't enough for you, huh? You wanted another Hunter Vanguard for your sick collection?",
    "80F1F20B": "I got my share of regrets, sure but not putting a bullet in you has gotta rank in the top three.",
    "80F1F20D": "Won't be long before a better Guardian than me puts you in your place.",
    "80F1F20F": "Just wish I could be there to see it.",
    "80F1F211": "This one's for the fellow calls himself the Drifter.",
    "80F1F213": "You did warn me running with you would put a target on my back.",
    "80F1F215": "Guess I'm in good company though, huh? After all, never had any fun without a little risk.",
    "80F1F217": "That's the whole idea with the operation you're putting together, ain't it?",
    "80F1F219": "MY idea, by the way. Had it, like, a million years ago, back when you were still handsome. So, uh, you're welcome. ",
    "80F1F21B": "You know, getting that up and running means coming out of hiding—giving you-know-who another shot at you.",
    "80F1F21D": "Hope I was around to see THAT showdown.",
    "80F1F21F": "Personally, my money was on the guy with the Golden Gun.",
    "80F1F221": "But hey, what do I know? I'm dead.",
    "80F1F223": "This one's for the strong, silent type. You.",
    "80F1F225": "Congratulations, buddy. I mean that.",
    "80F1F227": "Always knew you'd outdo me some day.",
    "80F1F229": "And if that means you had to do me in, too eh, you saved my life on Nessus, so I owed it to you anyway.",
    "80F1F22B": "Take care of the Ace of Spades, will ya? I'm not just talking about the maintenance; Banshee can help you with all that.",
    "80F1F22D": "I mean, take care of Ace. Use it well.",
    "80F1F22F": "Oh, hey, and if you found any of those papers from my earlier eh deployments?",
    "80F1F231": "Burn 'em.",
    "80F1F233": "Don't want people poking through the lives of Caydes 0 through 5. So just put it all behind you, OK?",
    "80F1F235": "Every story has an end. This is mine.",
    "80F1F237": "This one's for Eris Morn. Ahem.",
    "80F1F239": "If you're listening to this, congrats on killing me!",
    "80F1F23B": "I assume you became a Hive death god and fed me to your worm cult. [shuddering]",
    "80F1F23D": "That, or you just finally got sick of me.",
    "80F1F23F": "Coincidentally, if you didn't kill me and still somehow hear this I'm sorry for stealing your ship. And, oh, pretty much every other interaction we ever had.",
    "80F1F241": "But to be clear—if you DID kill me, I do NOT apologize, and I will consider all my actions 100% justified.",
    "80F1F243": "Either way, feel free to put your rock on my maps now. I don't need 'em anymore.",
    "80F1F245": "What're you calling it again? I wanna say Gary?",
    "80F1F247": "MY idea, by the way. You're welcome.",
    "80F1F249": "You did warn me running with you would get me killed.",
    "80F1F106": "The gate's powering up. Move quickly, Guardian!",
    "80F1F10A": "Ikora's portal should wrench the Undying Mind from wherever—whenever—it might be hiding. ",
    "80F1F10C": "Be ready. Once the beacon is deployed, there's no turning back.",
    "80F1F10E": "Last time we faced the Undying Mind, the Vex were trying to seal the Garden and resurrect the Black Heart. ",
    "80F1F110": "When Guardians last faced the Undying Mind, the Vex were trying to seal the Garden to resurrect the Black Heart.",
    "80F1F112": "The object of their worship. Darkness incarnate.",
    "80F1F114": "I wonder if that's still the case or if the Pyramid forced a change of priority. ",
    "80F1F116": "The data I'm gathering from my scans isn't making sense. Not entirely unexpected where the Vex are concerned, but",
    "80F1F118": "The gate network is spinning up connections to thousands of divergent realities. All at once.",
    "80F1F11A": "This is more than a few Vex leaking out of the Garden. There's something bigger going on here.",
    "80F1F11C": "There are hundreds, maybe thousands of copies of the Undying Mind lurking in the network. ",
    "80F1F11E": "The only way we'll put an end to the Vex incursions on the Moon is by destroying every last one.",
    "80F1F120": "We've got a lot of work ahead of us. This fight is just step one.",
    "80F1F122": "Every Vex we destroy in the Garden is one less threat to deal with on the Moon. ",
    "80F1F124": "But until we get to the bottom of these incursions, they'll just keep coming. ",
    "80F1F126": "Nightmares will be the least of our concerns if we can't contain the Vex.",
    "80F1F128": "Undying Mind presence confirmed. Let's find it and put it down.",
    "80F1F12A": "There's an Undying Mind skulking around the Vex Gate Network. Let's knock it out of warp and take it down. ",
    "80F1F12C": "Scan complete—there's an Undying Mind lurking up ahead. That's our target. ",
    "80F1F12E": "Undying Mind presence confirmed. Let's go to work, Guardian.",
    "80F1F130": "If my scans are accurate, there's a copy of the Undying Mind up ahead. Let's get after it.",
    "80F1F132": "Let's get to work. The Vex are warping to the Moon as we speak.",
    "80F1F134": "Every Vex we destroy in the Garden is one less threat to deal with on the Moon. Let's do some damage.",
    "80F1F136": "I'm detecting an energy spike. The gate network is surging. Work quickly, Guardian.",
    "80F1F138": "Vex activity's on the rise. Let's throw a wrench in the operation.",
    "80F1F13A": "The gate network's lit up. Lots of Vex on their way to the Moon. Slow them down, Guardian.",
    "80F1F13C": "Now that Ikora's portal is ready, we've got everything we need to draw the Undying Mind out of hiding.",
    "80F1F13E": "Well, this Undying Mind, anyway.",
    "80F1F140": "Ikora and Zavala have already taken out dozens of copies. Now it's our turn. Let's move.",
    "80F1F142": "The Black Garden. The source of the Vex incursions on the Moon. ",
    "80F1F144": "We can't shut down the Vex Gate Network entirely. But we can thin out their forces. Slow the assault.",
    "80F1F146": "Let's do some damage, gather what intel we can, and get it back to Ikora.",
    "80F1F148": "The Vex are warping troops onto the Moon as fast as the network will allow. We have to disrupt the process.",
    "80F1F14A": "That conflux tower should do the trick. But be ready—the Vex won't react kindly to the disruption.",
    "80F1F14C": "We did it. That won't stop the incursions, but it'll buy us some time—and we got the data we need.",
    "80F1F182": "Transferring to Ikora now. Let's get back to the Tower.",
    "80F1F258": "Great work, Guardian. That's one Undying Mind down. But there are still a great many more left to go.",
    "80F1F25A": "Fortunately for us, we're not alone in this fight. ",
    "80F1F267": "I think that's the last of them—for now, anyway. The Moon can breathe a little bit easier. ",
    "80F1F269": "That's one more Vex incursion soundly prevented. But there will be more. There's always more.",
    "80F1F26B": "Vex activity's settling down. That ought to slow their progress considerably. Great work.",
    "80F1F26D": "The gate network's quiet for now. Outstanding work, Guardian. ",
    "80F1F26F": "The Vex made us work for it, but we put a big dent in their numbers today. Now let's do it again.",
    "80F1F271": "I could watch the Undying Mind explode all day long. And thanks to the Vex, I just might. ",
    "80F1F273": "I bet the Vex felt that one. Undying Mind destroyed. Outstanding work, Guardian.",
    "80F1F275": "Another Undying Mind dismantled. But there are still more copies out there—and still more work to do. Let's get to it. ",
    "80F1F277": "Every copy of the Undying Mind that we destroy gets us closer to shutting this whole operation down. Great work.",
    "80F1F279": "One more Undying Mind for the pile. Only a few thousand left to go. But we're getting there.",
    "80F1F27B": "That's one more instantiation of the Undying Mind for our tally. Ikora will be pleased.",
    "80F1F27D": "It worked! Take them out before they warp away!",
    "80F1F2FE": "It should have been me.",
    "80F1F301": "Those barbarians tortured you for longer than I care to imagine and for what?",
    "80F1F302": "All the wisdom, the mystique it was in that mask you wore, not who was behind it. It was in the robes that the city made for you, not who wore them.",
    "80F1F303": "Do I tell the world what we really knew about you?",
    "80F1F304": "No. I bear many burdens. One of them is what I know and what the world can never know.",
    "80F1F305": "Was it a mistake to assault the City?",
    "80F1F306": "How many lives were lost that night, in pursuit of taking back our home from the Red Legion? Guardian and mortal alike.",
    "80F1F307": "I was almost one of them. I wake up some nights still feeling that Cabal boot on my neck. Maybe I wanted it to end that way.",
    "80F1F308": "And in the end, what was it all for? Here we stand under the Traveler, our home reclaimed. One enemy defeated, and two more take their place.",
    "80F1F309": "Nothing to stop another conqueror from storming the gates.",
    "80F1F30A": "Unless there are gates that no conqueror can breach.",
    "80F1F30B": "Another day, another leadership meeting without one-third of our supposed leaders.",
    "80F1F30C": "Cayde's attendance was infrequent before the Red War. Now we barely see him at all.",
    "80F1F30D": "Every week, I see more reports of his ship making unsanctioned flights all over the system. There are too many for me to read.",
    "80F1F30E": "He learned the wrong lesson from his time on Nessus. Now he tries to do everything himself. Taking risks that a true leader can't afford.",
    "80F1F30F": "I've heard the rumors. Cayde-6 the bounty hunter. The Exo who brings justice. But justice is nothing before duty.",
    "80F1F310": "Someday? The Hunter Vanguard will roll snake eyes one too many times. And we won't be there to bail him out.",
    "80F1F311": "I used to stand in the Underwatch and beg the Traveler to wake.",
    "80F1F312": "Traveler, how can we survive another Six Fronts. Traveler, Oryx will be too much for us. Silence.",
    "80F1F313": "When did our sleeping god finally choose to rise from its slumber? When it saw one unworthy of its power.",
    "80F1F314": "If Ghaul had never taken the City, would the Traveler have ever awakened?",
    "80F1F315": "And what happens the next time it decides someone is unworthy of its gift?",
    "80F1F316": "We need to be ready.",
    "80F1F317": "I was wrong.",
    "80F1F318": "The hero of the Red War stood before me, and I said 'the City is everywhere humanity sets foot.'",
    "80F1F31A": "I said we would dare to behold the unknown. And then we beheld it.",
    "80F1F31B": "A Vex mind more powerful than anything we could imagine. An ancient god of our darkest enemy.",
    "80F1F31C": "I said we will walk in the light of distant stars. But I was wrong. We're not even ready for what our own star illuminates.",
    "80F1F31D": "I was right about one thing. Walls do keep our enemies out. We must build them stronger, and higher.",
    "80F1F31E": "To do any less is to abandon our duty.",
    "80F1F31F": "Whoa, whoa, what is this? 'Personal audio log of Commander Zavala'? I didn't request that!",
    "80F1F320": "Huh.  Okay, don't be mad.",
    "80F1F321": "Ana'",
    "80F1F323": "Look, it was a different time, okay? Zavala had just popped up. It seemed like he was going to try to get in the way, so I started looking into other solutions.",
    "80F1F324": "Secretly injecting code into my subroutines so I auto-hack the Titan Vanguard's encrypted personal files isn't a 'solution!' It is a PROBLEM! A big problem!",
    "80F1F325": "Information isn't good or bad — it's how you use it. I've got other stuff to worry about here. Listen to those logs or don't. It's your choice.",

    "80F1F866": "If you see one Hive soldier, a hundred more are waitin' for you that you don't see—yet.",
    "80F1F868": "Hive claws make great can openers, and you can wear the chitin in subzero temps.",
    "80F1F86A": "Takes about a hundred of Shaxx's Redjacks to kill a Hive Knight. Why does he bother building 'em?",
    "80F1F86C": "The Hive die just like everything else. You just gotta find the soft parts.",
    "80F1F86E": "Think you could eat a Hive Knight? Those're the questions you ask yourself on the frontier.",
    "80F1F870": "Fun fact: You can ignite Hive guts for a little fire out in the wild. It's toasty.",
    "80F1F872": "The Hive don't scare you, do they? Guess you did kill a god of theirs. Or two.",
    "80F1F874": "I like fightin' Hive. They make those funny little sounds when you crunch 'em.",
    "80F1F876": "You know the Hive in this system are scared o' you? I don't know what you did to 'em—but it worked.",
    "80F1F878": "Warlocks keep telling me if the Vex could time travel, they'd have won already. Shoot 'em anyway.",
    "80F1F87A": "The Vex have consolidated their subtypes. You must be kicking the crap out of 'em.",
    "80F1F87C": "If the Vex can time travel, maybe they've already won. I mean, we're down to one Last City.",
    "80F1F87E": "Last time I fought the Vex, my crew rode their gate network. No one survived 'cept me.",
    "80F1F880": "You ever pull a gun off a Vex arm? Don't bother. They won't shoot anymore.",
    "80F1F882": "If you can defuse the self-destruct on a Vex Hydra, you can sleep in the shell at night.",
    "80F1F884": "You ever kill a Vex? I mean, truly and completely? I'm not convinced they don't just get rebuilt.",
    "80F1F886": "You think the Vex are alive? Are they just machines? You think they wonder?",
    "80F1F888": "If you catch Vex instead of kill 'em, you could double the City's power, easy. Just sayin'.",
    "80F1F88A": "Vex have that soft spot at the center. Bet you could cook that—eat it.",
    "80F1F97C": "My ship has eaten well today, Guardian. But every great meal risks indigestion. Can you fix this issue for us? Consider it a test.",
    "80F1F980": "Leviathan has gorged herself too freely! Will you see to her upset stomach? Eating Vex can cause nausea.",
    "80F1F981": "[laughs] The Leviathan is a voracious eater. And not very picky, as the Vex can attest. Oh, their frames are choking my beautiful machine.",
    "80F1F982": "Good! You survived! But that Mind kept this belly full. What will you do now? [laughs]",
    "80F1F984": "Well done! But that Vex Mind was the only thing keeping Leviathan's throat shut!",
    "80F1F985": "You are powerful! But Leviathan is unstuck. And SHE. IS. HUNGRY!",
    "80F1F987": "Oh no! [laughs] You'd better hold onto something!",
    "80F1F988": "[laughs] Relax! I have you, Traveler-spawn. You fought well. But let this be a lesson: I can offer you something greater than Light. I can keep you safe.",
    "80F1F98A": "I'm beginning to think there might be more to you than the cosmic power you wield.",
    "80F1F98B": "Given time, I believe you and I will forge miracles together. I promise you: we will meet again.",
    "80F1F98C": "[laughs] I wouldn't let harm befall you after you so deftly proved yourself. Welcome back to my coffers.",
    "80F1F98E": "My Loyalists and I have been busy. The end is coming, and we must make ready.",
    "80F1F98F": "In the meantime, take comfort in the fact that I did not allow you to perish. I will find you again.",
    "80F1F990": "I won't allow your death to be so trivial. Not after you supplanted Ghaul in such decisive fashion.",
    "80F1F992": "You were magnificent today. You gorge yourself on danger, you embrace death.",
    "80F1F994": "When the end comes, I know you'll embrace that, too. And believe me, it will be far more enjoyable to face it together. Reflect on this. And know that tomorrow is not guaranteed.",
    "80F1F995": "Halt your attack, Loyalists! I've not met this Guardian. Perhaps he'd like to solve our little engine problem. [laughs]",
    "80F1F997": "Have you come seeking another challenge? You've seen the extent of my power, and yet you still persist. How amusing!",
    "80F1F999": "Loyalists, stand down! Have you considered my offer, Guardian? Welcome back to the Leviathan!",
    "80F1F99B": "[laughs] Let them pass! Let them pass. If the Guardians insist, then we shall entertain them.",
    "80F1F99C": "I wonder why you've come, Guardian. You wish to fight another of my decoys? Believe me—it will be more pleasurable to fight together—and share a drink.",
    "80F1F99E": "I'm curious. You came of your own volition. What do you hope to find here? Conflict? Death? Or power?",
    "80F1F9A0": "I'm touched you've come back to me so soon! Let's revel in death and destruction together!",
    "80F1F9A2": "If you wish to enter, then by all means, dive in. [laughs]",
    "80F1F9A3": "We have other guests aboard. You'll have to settle the matter of space amongst yourselves. [laughs]",
    "80F1F9A4": "Always mind your step aboard the Leviathan. [laughs]",
    "80F1FB73": "The convergence interval is nearing its end. Do not waste this opportunity. ",
    "80F1FB76": "Did I mention that you should go faster? GO FASTER.",
    "80F1FB77": "We're running out of time.",
    "80F1FB78": "If the Fallen escape, the simulation ends, and the Vex will harvest their data.",
    "80F1FB79": "There! Those platforms!",
    "80F1FB7A": "The simulation window is closing, but you are near the payload that the Fallen are trying to extract. ",
    "80F1FB7B": "The combination of constants and variables in this simulation is fascinating.",
    "80F1FB7C": "Rigid structure in movement, dynamism in engagement, all within a strict framework. Beautiful. ",
    "80F1FB7D": "Unfortunately, I must destroy it when you're finished.",
    "80F1FB7E": "If it helps, try not to look down.",
    "80F1FB7F": "Well done. You've prevented the Vex from mining any data about the Fallen. It will force the Network Minds to recalculate their strategy.",
    "80F1FB80": "And we'll be there to stop them.",
    "80F1FB81": "Nice. One more Vex master plan thwarted.",
    "80F1FB82": "There will be others.",
    "80F1FB83": "And we'll stop them too. Just enjoy the moment.",
    "80F1FB84": "Outstanding. Even the Vex could not have anticipated your victory. ",
    "80F1FB85": "And you'd think they would by now.",
    "80F1FB86": "Get to the platforms! We're almost out of time!",
    "80F1FB87": "It is unfortunate that the Vex completed their calculations. ",
    "80F1FB88": "You'll get 'em next time.",
    "80F1FB89": "Look at it this way. So the Vex collected some data. But YOU still dusted a lot of Fallen. And that's always a good day.",
    "80F1FB8B": "When you put it that way, I agree.",
    "80F1FB8C": "Take heart. Even though the Vex retrieved their data, your efforts may have already altered its usefulness. ",
    "80F1FB8D": "Hmm. I wonder if they predicted that?",
    "80F1FB8E": "All hostiles down. The Vex got the data, but this bunch isn't getting up again.",
    "80F1FB8F": "A few less bad guys running around the Infinite Forest? I'm OK with that.",
    "80F1FB90": "Enemies closing on your position. We've lost our chance to deny the Vex information, but we can still destroy the Fallen.",
    "80F1FB91": "OK, forget the timer. Go to plan B: take out the Fallen.",
    "80F1FB92": "The Vex have extracted the data from this simulation. All that is left is the battle. ",
    "80F1FB93": "We're out of time. Incoming reinforcements!",
    "80F1FB94": "Keep to the path. Your persistence will be your enemy's undoing.",
    "80F1FB95": "More platforms.  And this is why the Vex have no sense of humor.  Or friends.",
    "80F1FB96": "Use caution. This particular simulation is constantly adapting. ",
    "80F1FB98": "We can predict the platform movements, but we can't stop them.",
    "80F1FB99": "I have seen evidence that leads me to believe the phasing platforms shift between different realities.",
    "80F1FB9A": "Vex—always have to do everything the hard way.",
    "80F1FB9B": "You're doing great. Just don't think about what happens if you fall.",
    "80F1FB9C": "Great. Now I'm thinking about it.",
    "80F1FB9D": "Excellent. Another reality path closed to the Vex. ",
    "80F1FB9E": "Told you they were good.",
    "80F1FB9F": "The Vex are studying the measures Fallen use for retreat--developing strategies to prevent theft of their technology.",
    "80F1FBA0": "So go take out some Fallen.",
    "80F1FBA1": "You must act quickly. Once the simulation completes, the Vex will harvest the data.",
    "80F1FBA2": "We have received a message from our wise leader: 'Send the Guardian. The Vex are simulating a Fallen extraction to gather data on tactical retreats. Disrupt them.'",
    "80F1FBA4": "He was so urgent that he could not include a word for me, the most humble and well-read scholar of Osirian lore.",
    "80F1FBA5": "The Vex are simulating the Fallen's capability for retreat. I need you to attack it and destabilize their experiment. ",
    "80F1FBA7": "All this predicting, and they never predict that we're going to air-drop the Guardian on them. Again.",
    "80F1FBA9": "Wow, never let it be said you're not the champ of cutting it close.",
    "80F1FBAB": "In most other simulations, you've already lost. Move quickly! ",
    "80F1FBAD": "Just as a reminder, that convergence interval IS closing soon.",
    "80F1FBAE": "The Vex are aware of your presence. They're manipulating platforms to slow you down. Remember: get in, eliminate the Fallen, and get out.",
    "80F1FBAF": "The Vex defensive protocols are active. They're attempting to prevent you from reaching your Fallen targets by altering the geometry around you.",
    "80F1FBB0": "The Vex controlling this simulation have been alerted to your presence. No new constructs, but they've begun to shift the terrain.",
    "80F1FBB1": "If these readings are correct, the destination gateway is heavily protected. This simulation must be valuable.",
    "80F1FBB2": "There's nothing the Vex value more than unique data.",
    "80F1FBB3": "So why the sudden focus on the Fallen? The Vex haven't shown much interest in them before.",
    "80F1FBB4": "Who but the Vex can say? Their network is always adapting. With Panoptes destroyed, their directives were bound to change.",
    "80F1FBB5": "So the Vex have moved on to experimentation with the Fallen. Is it too much to hope they'll destroy each other?",
    "80F1FBB6": "Don't hope. We'll deal with them ourselves.",
    "80F1FBB7": "Why simulate the Fallen? They've never been weaker.",
    "80F1FBB8": "The Vex intend to erase all other lifeforms. Powerful, or weak. Affluent or destitute. Anywhere we can stop them, we must.",
    "80F1FBB9": "Guardian. Ghost. I've obtained the coordinates to a Vex combat test within the Forest, designed to study the fighting capabilities of the Fallen. They must be preparing an invasion.",
    "80F1FBBB": "We've got this. The Vex can't study the Fallen if we delete them.",
    "80F1FBBC": "The Vex run all kinds of things in the Forest now, including combat tests on Fallen. They're planning some kind of invasion, possibly on Nessus.",
    "80F1FBBD": "You want us to ruin their test case? We've got guns. We can do that.",
    "80F1FBBE": "Ghost! Guardian! The Vex are running a combat loop against Fallen hostiles.",
    "80F1FBC0": "But it won't be much of a test if we get rid of all those simulated Fallen.",
    "80F1FBC1": "Exactly.",
    "80F1FBC2": "The Vex have a protective subroutine on this particular simulation. They will do whatever they can to defend it. ",
    "80F1FBC3": "Shouldn't be a problem.",
    "80F1FBC4": "They try to anticipate and model every variable. But they cannot predict you. ",
    "80F1FBC5": "Osiris and I are running cover for you by causing a little chaos in a nearby simulation. But the Vex know we're interested in this Fallen experiment, too. Expect a strong response.",
    "80F1FBC6": "Always.",
    "80F1FBC7": "You are near the target. Do what you must to stop the Fallen.",
    "80F1FBC8": "We know how to do that.",
    "80F1FBC9": "They're not wasting any time. And neither should we.",
    "80F1FBCA": "By the way, the Vex have you on a time limit. Don't let those Fallen escape!",
    "80F1FBCC": "We can handle it.",
    "80F1FBCD": "Remember, you will not have much time to act. Move with purpose, and strike with intent. ",
    "80F1FBCE": "C'mon, he gets it! This is one of MY Guardians we're talking about.",
    "80F1FBD1": "The Hive constantly adapt and evolve, generating new mutations as naturally as we breathe. The Vex know this, and seek to catalog and exploit these mutations in real time.",
    "80F1FBD4": "So hey, it'd be great if you could smash this simulation before the Vex can learn anything of value.",
    "80F1FBD5": "So, the Vex are simulating the Hive to test a new reality path. There's an opportunity there.",
    "80F1FBD6": "Go cause trouble. The Vex don't handle 'unexpected input' that well.",
    "80F1FBD7": "Mess up the tests, give them nothing but garbage output—I like it!",
    "80F1FBD8": "So this is what it feels like when we're in total agreement. Weirrrd.",
    "80F1FBD9": "Too many Hive! They're breaking my link to the Vex data stream.",
    "80F1FBDA": "Keep the Hive away from the plate, or I'll lose my connection to the data.",
    "80F1FBDB": "They've disrupted my sync with the simulation! We have to get the Hive away from the plate.",
    "80F1FBDC": "The Forest can generate so many Hive—it might as well be their homeworld.",
    "80F1FBDD": "We've thought about that.",
    "80F1FBDE": "Have you simulated the Hive homeworld?",
    "80F1FBDF": "Didn't go well.",
    "80F1FBE0": "Oryx wouldn't need the Ascendant Realm if he had the Forest.",
    "80F1FBE1": "I've run that simulation. Oryx always needs an Ascendant Realm.",
    "80F1FBE2": "You two do know Oryx is dead, right?",
    "80F1FBE3": "You two ever read the 'Books of Sorrow'? Scary stories. It's way more Hive than I ever wanted.",
    "80F1FBE4": "I found them illuminating.",
    "80F1FBE5": "You call it 'history,' I call it 'a terrifying glimpse into their creepy nightmare sword logic.'",
    "80F1FBE6": "Take care to keep your focus once the swarm of Hive begins. Even the strongest of wills can erode beneath a flood of shadow.",
    "80F1FBE8": "I am not too proud to admit that I have known fear against the Hive. Even within the Infinite Forest.",
    "80F1FBE9": "Simulated Hive are just as bad as the real thing.",
    "80F1FBEA": "You think you know what is real? Enough time with the Vex will change that.",
    "80F1FBEB": "This might surprise you, but we've got enough to worry about without adding an existential crisis.",
    "80F1FBEC": "That's one sector down. Let's see if we can stick it out. The more corrupted data we feed the Vex, the better.",
    "80F1FBED": "That's the first wave down, but I can sense the simulation rebooting. The more we kill, the more data we corrupt.",
    "80F1FBEE": "Good—the first data set has been completely ruined. Hang in there.",
    "80F1FBEF": "Keep going. We've finished the first wave, but the Vex data collection is incomplete.",
    "80F1FBF0": "Excellent. Chaos sown in the Infinite Forest. Chaos in the data gathered by the Vex.",
    "80F1FBF1": "You weren't with our mutual friend as long as I was. Turns out chaos isn't that rare for them.",
    "80F1FBF3": "All done in there? Good. Vex misfortune is one of my favorite things.",
    "80F1FBF4": "Of course, with all the bad data you're feeding them, there could be side effects in other simulations. Like the one you're in. Time to go!",
    "80F1FBF5": "Done. Even I'M having trouble keeping track of all the bugs in their system now.",
    "80F1FBF6": "Then maybe you should get out of there, before the entire sim glitches out.",
    "80F1FBF7": "Didn't think of that.",
    "80F1FBF8": "Barrier's back! We'll need an Arc charge. And a Cyclops to eliminate.",
    "80F1FBF9": "They returned power to the barrier. Let's find a Cyclops.",
    "80F1FBFA": "Security barrier's back up. Let's rip into another Cyclops and get a new Arc charge.",
    "80F1FBFB": "These readings are similar to the ones deep in the arcology on Titan.",
    "80F1FBFC": "The Hive. The prophecies speak of this. When the Mind is buried and the Keeper returns, the horde will rise from the black.",
    "80F1FBFD": "Looks like we've got a chance to sabotage some Vex data collection. They're running a Hive simulation.",
    "80F1FBFE": "Deliberately ruining data goes against my beliefs as a Ghost, but I'll make an exception.",
    "80F1FBFF": "With Panoptes out of commission, the Infinite Forest is finally vulnerable to attack, both direct and otherwise.",
    "80F1FC00": "Otherwise is us. 'Direct' is where you come in. You two up for another round of 'shoot the Hive and corrupt the Vex'?",
    "80F1FC01": "Another swarm of Hive in the Forest. Endless as the Darkness.",
    "80F1FC02": "Don't be so grim. What Osiris means to say is that the Vex are running another Hive simulation. It's gonna get messy.",
    "80F1FC03": "Welcome back. The Vex are running a simulation with the Hive, testing some new variable. It's not clear what they want, but I'm betting it ends badly for us.",
    "80F1FC05": "Not if we end them first. Let's hunt some Hive. ",
    "80F1FC06": "They're ready to go again. You'd better be ready, too.",
    "80F1FC08": "Looks like they want to go another round. Knock 'em dead.",
    "80F1FC09": "The Hive in Mercury's past. Do the Vex know something about the Collapse we don't?",
    "80F1FC0A": "Here they come. Let's put some fear into them.",
    "80F1FC0B": "The longer we can hold off the Hive, the more I can corrupt the Vex data. Get ready!",
    "80F1FC0D": "The more Hive we take apart, the more data we corrupt.",
    "80F1FC0E": "Let's wreck some Hive and go home. This Forest gives me the creeps.",
    "80F1FC0F": "Every Hive we kill is an unanswered question for the Vex.",
    "80F1FC10": "Trouble in the Forest. I'm picking up Vex activity and Hive bioenergetics.",
    "80F1FC11": "Detecting Vex and Hive signatures in the Forest. Might be worth checking out.",
    "80F1FC12": "Picking up a message from Osiris. He and Sagira want us to head into the Forest. Something about an experiment involving the Hive",
    "80F1FC13": "I'm reading bioenergy deep inside the Forest. The Vex are working on something involving the Hive.",
    "80F1FC14": "Bioenergetics detected. The Vex are running Hive simulations.",
    "80F1FC15": "Let's introduce an 'uncontrolled variable' and destroy their precious simulation.",
    "80F1FC16": "Get ready to trash some data! And by trash, I mean 'destroy Hive.'",
    "80F1FC18": "Oh, no. We're not done with you.",
    "80F1FC1B": "I hate it when they run.",
    "80F1FC1C": "Aaand he's on the run. Bet you can stop him.",
    "80F1FC1D": "Stay focused, Guardian. Do not let your thirst for victory cloud your judgment. ",
    "80F1FC1F": "He got away, huh? You take pity on him?",
    "80F1FC20": "Leave them be, Sagira.",
    "80F1FC21": "That's the last of them. But more reinforcements are on the way.",
    "80F1FC22": "Then I suggest you get out of there while you still have a chance.",
    "80F1FC23": "He's gone, but his friends aren't going to make this easy.",
    "80F1FC24": "A valiant effort to stop their process. Never stop fighting.",
    "80F1FC25": "We've lost him.",
    "80F1FC26": "If they're trying to transmit data, why use the Cabal?",
    "80F1FC27": "That is what we must determine through careful study and observation.",
    "80F1FC29": "I say you smash first and ask questions later.",
    "80F1FC2A": "This continual Vex reliance on the Cabal is unusual, even for them. I find it troubling.",
    "80F1FC2B": "I find it troubling that you find it troubling. You usually have an answer for everything. ",
    "80F1FC2C": "If I didn't know any better, I'd say the Vex appear to be obsessed with this one Cabal simulation.",
    "80F1FC2D": "Obsession implies emotion, Sagira. The Vex are seeking a result, one they may be unable to reproduce any other way.",
    "80F1FC2E": "I have seen what is to come. If we are to avert disaster, we must continue to fight the Vex. This phage cannot be allowed to escape the Forest.",
    "80F1FC2F": "The big guy's down, and the Vex have to start their experiment again. I like it.",
    "80F1FC30": "Yes, good. This will force the Vex to recalibrate.",
    "80F1FC31": "That means 'thank you' in Osiris.",
    "80F1FC32": "He's making a break for it. Let's drop him.",
    "80F1FC33": "Even if the outcome is not what you desired, the enemy has suffered losses.",
    "80F1FC34": "See, he likes blowing up bad guys as much as we do.",
    "80F1FC36": "Another abstraction destroyed. Their data might have reached its destination, but its framework will soon be lost.",
    "80F1FC37": "And that is still a measurable victory against an enemy like the Vex. Well done.",
    "80F1FC38": "With everything they could be doing in the Forest, why would the Vex choose to focus so much effort on a solitary Cabal in a single simulation?",
    "80F1FC39": "It will depend on how important that one Cabal is. What it carries may be critical to their ultimate plans.",
    "80F1FC3A": "The Vex are focusing a lot of processing power on this particular simulation. This is a big deal for them.",
    "80F1FC3B": "If you can tell that, can't you terminate it from your end?",
    "80F1FC3C": "Ever try to remotely control a machine on a perpetual feedback loop? YOU'RE the off switch. Go close it down.",
    "80F1FC3E": "OK, let's see what's inside. Oh. This is code for what looks like a phage. Part technology, part biology. Just like the Vex.",
    "80F1FC3F": "Now's our chance.",
    "80F1FC40": "Guardian, I've detected a single Cabal within a simulation, carrying encrypted data between two points.",
    "80F1FC42": "The scientist in me would say the Vex are running a test—a continual loop to establish a benchmark dataset. To what end, I am not sure.",
    "80F1FC43": "Sounds like we'd better find out what they're after.",
    "80F1FC44": "You should know that the Vex have moved this test to the top of their priority stack. Organization is super important to reality-bending robots.",
    "80F1FC45": "Clearly, this experiment is of vital importance to their plans.",
    "80F1FC46": "Then that makes it important to us.",
    "80F1FC47": "It's funny. The Vex keep running the same test, but they haven't changed the defenses yet.",
    "80F1FC48": "They are eliminating all stray variables that could affect their results.",
    "80F1FC49": "So, Guardian Go be you—the stray variable.",
    "80F1FC4B": "There's something odd about the Vex test. It doesn't provide insights into Cabal behavior. Unless you count Cabal trapped in mazes.",
    "80F1FC4C": "At this point, they may not be studying the Cabal.",
    "80F1FC4D": "Which means they're studying us.",
    "80F1FC4E": "The Vex are continuing their studies of Cabal behavior. They have reestablished the encrypted data transmission.",
    "80F1FC4F": "More to the point, the Cabal are marching again. Better get moving.",
    "80F1FC50": "Remember that big Cabal trapped in the labyrinth? You're not going to believe this—it's back.",
    "80F1FC51": "Guardian, it appears our work remains incomplete. In their drive to eliminate another variable blocking them from shaping reality, the Vex have restarted their tests of Cabal movements. ",
    "80F1FC53": "Right. Space rhinos, mazes, killer phage. You know, the usual Vex end-of-the-galaxy scheme.",
    "80F1FC55": "Detecting traces of familiar Light up here. Wait Saint-14? He's been missing for decades.",
    "80F1FC58": "Saint was one of the greatest Titans who ever lived. Hero of Six Fronts. All that power and he just vanished. The City's still looking for him.",
    "80F1FC59": "Vex from all times, fighting together. Like they were pulled here by the rift in the time stream—a rift Saint-14 made with his Light.",
    "80F1FC5A": "If he still lives, then we must find him.",
    "80F1FC5B": "Already ahead of you on that one. You start searching in here. We'll head back to the Lighthouse and see if Vance knows anything.",
    "80F1FC5C": "What was that?",
    "80F1FC5D": "Light! The conflux was holding back a rift full of Light!",
    "80F1FC5E": "If Saint-14 is lost in the Infinite Forest, it's because he came here to find us.",
    "80F1FC5F": "You can't blame yourself for every missing Guardian, Osiris.",
    "80F1FC61": "For him I can.",
    "80F1FC62": "The signal's coming from a Vex conflux. But there's something odd. The time stream around it is unstable.",
    "80F1FC63": "I don't know anything that could do that. Get me to it. Maybe we can figure this out. ",
    "80F1FC64": "I'm picking up a signal. It's faint, but it's definitely coming from the Forest. Sounds like an old Vanguard code.",
    "80F1FC65": "Perhaps you hear the final dreams of the lost.",
    "80F1FC66": "Uh thanks? Very helpful. Since I can't track 'dreams of the lost,' how about we go find that signal?",
    "80F1FC67": "The signal's getting stronger. I should be able to find the source, but there's some kind of interference.",
    "80F1FC68": "Signals tend to overlap, get mixed up with simulations It can be hard to find what's real and what's not in here.",
    "80F1FC81": "Thank you. I don't know what I would have done if Osiris hadn't sent you to me.",
    "80F1FC84": "Vex from different timelines are converging on Mercury. That's bad.",

    "80F1FC86": "I will notify the Followers that you are coming.",
    "80F1FC87": "In return, the Followers of Osiris can help you revive his Ghost. We have a hidden temple on Earth. Take Sagira to these coordinates.",
    "80F1FC88": "There is a Vex gateway near your location. Osiris spent years studying it. He was convinced it was the door to the Infinite Forest.",
    "80F1FC89": "If it is still possible to find Osiris, we need to open that door.",

    "80F1FC90": "Osiris preserve us! YOU have his Ghost? Sagira? Please—please—bring her to me!",
    "80F1FC91": "This is easier to get to than their old place, that's for sure.",
    "80F1FC92": "Come closer.",
    "80F1FC93": "The Traveler transformed Mercury into a garden world. It was a paradise until the Vex came.",
    "80F1FC94": "The Vex REPLACED the planet's core with their own machines. We call it the 'Infinite Forest.'",
    "80F1FC95": "An ever-expanding labyrinth of realities. No two paths are ever the same. No one has ever escaped.",
    "80F1FC96": "It was Osiris's obsession.",

    "80F1FC9C": "The Vex are at my door. Osiris has not returned. Faith is all I have left.",
    "80F1FC9D": "There! Take out the module!",
    "80F1FCE7": "Panoptes! Face me!",

    "80F1FCF2": "No, Panoptes! Your future only has one ending now.",
    "80F1FCF3": "It's open but unstable. Go! I'll hold it open for as long as I can!",
    "80F1FCF4": "It took Osiris years of study to find a way to open the gateways. We don't have years, so",
    "80F1FCF5": "The charge—hurry!",
    "80F1FCF6": "Your time in the Infinite Forest ends now!",
    "80F1FCF7": "[sounds of effort]",

    "80F1FCFC": "Where is Osiris?",
    "80F1FCFD": "This is it. Whether it's us or Panoptes, someone's future is ending today.",
    "80F1FCFE": "We've gotta get to Panoptes before Osiris does. Without Sagira, if he dies, he dies for good.",

    "80F1FDC2": "Osiris has adapted some of the technology of the Forest to his own purposes. We're going to run into his Reflections.",

    "80F1FE47": "The Root Mind has rebuilt this spire entirely, complete with security measures. Sagira and I spent weeks taking it down. Vex efficiency will be the death of us all.",
    "80F1FE48": "You seem to know your way around. What else did I miss when I was out?",
    "80F1FE4A": "We jumped off a bunch of gravity cannons. Does that count?",
    "80F1FE4B": "Actually, yes.",
    "80F1FE4C": "When you destroyed the original Root Mind and left, we programmed demolition charges into every floor of this spire and reduced it to bits of data. It's unsettling to know that the Vex have rebuilt all of this so quickly.",

    "80F1FE59": "We hear you, Sagira.",
    "80F1FE5A": "We've, um, got an urgent Vex problem in the Forest.",
    "80F1FE5B": "You can solve most of those with explosions We’ll take a look.",
    "80F1FE5C": "Hey, guys? We've got a simulation in the Forest that is quickly spiraling out of control. Long story.",

    "80F1FE66": "I've recreated Dendron, the Root Mind. I thought I could control it.",
    "80F1FE67": "You always do. That's why people talk. Now that Panoptes has fallen, the Root Mind is attempting to take its place and govern the Forest.",
    "80F1FE68": "Well. Then let's blow it up.",

    "80F1FE70": "The Vex have been two steps ahead of us so far. But you and Ikora have given us a chance to actually SURPRISE them. That's impressive.",
    "80F1FE71": "So I guess what I'm saying is, when this is all over, I might actually miss being your Ghost just a little.",
    "80F1FE72": "Remember how I said the Vex anticipate everything? They have automated intruder countermeasures here. They'll react and block whatever we do.",

    "80F1FE9D": "I never thought I'd see how the Vex won Mercury. They're poisoning the world with radiolaria.",
    "80F1FE9E": "These radiolaria machines are everywhere.",
    "80F1FE9F": "They are the primary vector by which the Vex remade the planet.",
    "80F1FEA0": "All right, we have to get to the top of that tower, and download the algorithm before the Vex create the Infinite Forest.",
    "80F1FEA1": "Many elements of your first visit have been recreated. Only the algorithm is missing. Fight as if your life depends on it because it does.",
    "80F1FEA2": "You say that like this isn't your fault.",
    "80F1FEA3": "It won’t happen again.",
    "80F1FEA4": "Yes. It will.",
    "80F1FEA5": "Welcome to the past, your personal past. The Root Mind has reestablished the conditions of your first visit and, I suspect, much of the defenses leading to its spire.",
    "80F1FEA7": "I'm blaming you for this, Osiris.",
    "80F1FEA8": "Blame whomever you'd like. Just destroy that Mind.",
    "80F1FEA9": "Welcome back. You should remember this. You did great the first time.",
    "80F1FEAB": "I wasn't here the first time. Someone stole my shell.",
    "80F1FEAC": "Borrowed. I borrowed it. To save all of time and space.",
    "80F1FEAD": "Aaannnd got him! Panoptes always ends up in the same coordinates. It's over. This is how we beat the Vex.",
    "80F1FEAE": "That's it! We've done it!",
    "80F1FEAF": "All clear. Osiris, you said this was your simulation? Well, your pet Vex left a simulated corpse.",
    "80F1FEB0": "It wasn't a pet—not that time. Well, thank you for your help, Guardian. I've kept you from the Vanguard long enough.",
    "80F1FEB2": "Go do what you do best.",
    "80F1FEB3": "Root Mind has been neutralized. Osiris, if you had any plans for this thing when you simulated it, I'm afraid there's not much of it left.",
    "80F1FEB4": "You've done well, Guardian. That corpse could be useful. I'll retrieve it soon.",
    "80F1FEB6": "Root Mind has been dismantled. What's next? We're putting out fires all over the place today.",
    "80F1FEB7": "I'll be honest—I can't remember where we left you. We're in the middle of three separate simulations.",
    "80F1FEB8": "We just met the biggest Vex Cyclops I've ever seen. And we cracked it in half.",
    "80F1FEB9": "Oh, Dendron! Right! You're so good at cleaning up Osiris's messes. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. Now get out of there before the simulation shuts down.",
    "80F1FEBA": "That Root Mind looks right at home in its spire. And we did such a good job killing it the first time.",
    "80F1FEBB": "Doing this again will build character. Every battle is a learning experience, whether you're a god-slayer or a neophyte.",
    "80F1FEBC": "You sound like Lord Shaxx.",
    "80F1FEBD": "No. Shaxx sounds like me.",
    "80F1FEBE": "After the Guardian destroyed the Root Mind the first time, we spent weeks taking this simulation apart. The Vex have rebuilt it entirely. You've really messed things up this time, Osiris.",
    "80F1FEC0": "It was a risk I had to take, Sagira. The Guardian has this handled.",
    "80F1FF4F": "I've used the Forest to create a simulation of your Sparrow. You're gonna need it for that ramp.",
    "80F1FF52": "A Ghost can do that?",
    "80F1FF53": "I just did.",
    "80F1FF54": "That chasm in front of us looked uninviting, so I simulated a Sparrow for you.",
    "80F1FF55": "I had the same idea. You just said it first.",
    "80F1FF56": "While you were fighting, I was thinking of a way over that ramp, so I simulated your Sparrow. It's good to go!",
    "80F1FF58": "The Vex must know we're after the map—they're redirecting the Cabal to destroy it. We have to hurry.",
    "80F1FF59": "These Cabal must have a leader.",
    "80F1FF5A": "You're headed straight for him. He's caught in a window in time, trying to steal the map before we can get it. He'll fail every time, but he doesn't know that.",
    "80F1FF5B": "Sounds horrible.",
    "80F1FF5C": "The future where he succeeds is much worse.",
    "80F1FF5D": "I can't tell these Cabal apart from the real thing.",
    "80F1FF5E": "What's the difference? Vex simulations can kill. These copies have the same goal as their counterparts: find a future where the Legion wins the Red War.",
    "80F1FF5F": "Maybe a Sparrow could make that jump.",
    "80F1FF60": "Were you showing off? Listen, I already like you. You passed. You can relax.",
    "80F1FF62": "I'll keep the node sealed. You take care of the Red Legion.",
    "80F1FF63": "They've activated more lasers.",
    "80F1FF64": "It's hard not to admire the artistry.",
    "80F1FF65": "It's really not.",
    "80F1FF66": "OK. Find another gateway and I can get us to the node.",
    "80F1FF67": "The geometric data I'm reading from this architecture—it's subtly shifting. Like reality trying to decide on a version it likes.",
    "80F1FF68": "In the Forest, time itself is in flux.",
    "80F1FF69": "I don't like it.",
    "80F1FF6A": "This is a combat loop: a simulation of the recent past when the Cabal attacked Mercury. The Vex must be testing alternative outcomes.",
    "80F1FF6C": "That Minotaur is going to be trouble.",
    "80F1FF6D": "So, where's this Valus?",
    "80F1FF6E": "Wait for it",
    "80F1FF6F": "Scanning I can't find Panoptes. The map's too big; I can't search it fast enough. It changes constantly.",
    "80F1FF70": "I need more processing power. There are Vex Minds on Nessus that might do the trick.",
    "80F1FF71": "You up for a hunting expedition?",
    "80F1FF72": "I have reports of Red Legion activity on Mercury. Survivors from the Almighty.",
    "80F1FF73": "Survivors, huh? Let's finish the job.",
    "80F1FF74": "Look at that. Ahead of us. That has to be the map. The Infinite Forest is a doomsday machine, but when you see it like this it's almost beautiful.",
    "80F1FF75": "Coordinates locked. Let's get to that node. Then we can use the map to find Panoptes and stop the dark future.",
    "80F1FF76": "The Cabal's last incursion into the Infinite Forest created a glitch. Copies of them are stuck in a recursive loop. I need you to pursue and destroy them.",
    "80F1FF77": "We could. But I thought you had the Forest handled.",
    "80F1FF78": "I do. In multiple timelines across many simulations. This is a rare exception.",
    "80F1FF79": "Sure. We'll hunt some Cabal.",
    "80F1FF7A": "The Red Legion continues to patrol this area, and its campaign for the Infinite Forest rages on. Repeated incursions have caused a glitch, and a Legionary squad is now trapped in time.",
    "80F1FF7B": "I never get tired of paying them back for the Tower. We're on it.",
    "80F1FF7C": "Guardian, I need your help. Temporal copies of the Cabal invasion force have appeared within the Infinite Forest—an unfortunate glitch. Can I count on you to eliminate them?",
    "80F1FF7E": "Since you asked nicely, yes.",
    "80F1FF7F": "He was coached.",
    "80F1FF80": "Hey, team! Copies of the Cabal invasion are trapped inside the Infinite Forest, locked in a combat loop. On the, uh, off chance one of them escapes, possibly armed with world-breaking Vex tech",
    "80F1FF81": "Wouldn't be the first time. We'll handle this.",
    "80F1FF82": "Guardian! We've got Cabal loose. A glitch within the Forest has created copies of the invasion. Feel like a gunfight?",
    "80F1FF84": "Getting my Guardian into trouble is MY job.",
    "80F1FF86": "He likes me better.",
    "80F1FF88": "Whatever you say. Be there soon.",
    "80F1FF89": "My Hidden operatives tell me the Cabal have caused some kind of anomaly inside the Infinite Forest. Multiple squads from your first visit have been copied. Osiris is concerned.",
    "80F1FF8B": "You don't have to, but if you go in there, make sure the Cabal don't leave with any Vex tech.",
    "80F1FF8C": "Incoming transmission. Text only. 'Forest created copies of Cabal invasion. Eliminate them. —Osiris.'",
    "80F1FF8D": "We still can't track you in there, Guardian. No matter how much Asher wishes we could. If you're going in, watch your back.",
    "80F1FF8F": "What are you waiting for? We've got a dark future to avert.",
    "80F1FF90": "Osiris's Reflections must be searching for Panoptes, too. Even if he makes a million copies of himself, I don't think he'll find it in time. We need that map.",
    "80F1FF91": "I've alerted the Hidden to halt observation and keep clear of the Forest. Your fireteam is free to do its job. Good luck.",
    "80F1FF92": "You're showing up on the tracker. Good to see both of you again.",
    "80F1FF93": "Keep forgetting I wasn't here last time.",
    "80F1FF94": "It was so fun! I mean— you didn't miss much.",
    "80F1FF95": "Osiris says he's the protector of the Forest, but as far as the Vanguard is concerned, this is your territory. Good hunting.",
    "80F1FF96": "I can feel your approach, Guardian. Welcome back to the Forest.",
    "80F1FF98": "Sagira, I've been meaning to ask What are you and Osiris doing out here?",
    "80F1FF99": "We're not completely sure yet. Some light remodeling, maybe.",
    "80F1FF9A": "The Vex won't like that.",
    "80F1FF9B": "They don't have a say.",
    "80F1FF9C": "Looks like the Vex are trying to reestablish control of the Forest.",
    "80F1FF9D": "They can try. This Forest is mine now.",
    "80F1FF9E": "The Vanguard would disagree.",
    "80F1FF9F": "I didn't ask them.",
    "80F1FFA0": "Aaaand he's gonna be worse.",
    "80F1FFA1": "All done. Let's get that map.",
    "80F1FFA2": "Does anyone else feel like we've done this before?",
    "80F1FFA3": "Why do you keep asking that? I was the active Ghost last time. Now it's you.",
    "80F1FFA4": "I've never asked that.",
    "80F1FFA5": "Huh. I swear you did.",
    "80F1FFA6": "There's something strange about this Forest.",
    "80F1FFA7": "The Valus is down! I can't shake the sense of déjà vu. I feel like we've done this before.",
    "80F1FFA8": "You were here in spirit. I was using your shell.",
    "80F1FFA9": "Yeah, I remember now.",
    "80F1FFAA": "All Cabal eliminated. We'll make a full report to the Vanguard.",
    "80F1FFAB": "It's always an honor, Guardian. Take care of him, Ghost.",
    "80F1FFAD": "If he'll let me.",
    "80F1FFAF": "Osiris would send his thanks, but he's already knee-deep in another simulation.",
    "80F1FFB0": "Of course he is. We know the way out. Try not to glitch any more Cabal into existence.",
    "80F1FFB1": "He's going for the map! Hurry!",
    "80F1FFB2": "The Vex activated their security grid.",
    "80F1FFB3": "They see you and the Cabal as invaders. Relax. It worked out fine the first time.",
    "80F1FFB4": "The Vex just turned up their security measures. Trying to flush us out of here.",
    "80F1FFB5": "Almost got him. Let's finish this.",
    "80F1FFFB": "You have been a great ally to us today and to Osiris.",
    "80F1FFFF": "The Followers will remember you fought to close the crossroads.",
    "80F5C001": "The crossroads have closed, but the Vex will march again someday. We must be ready.",
    "80F5C002": "Even the smallest action creates ripples through time and space.",
    "80F5C003": "Osiris sees all. Including your valiant effort to fight the Vex.",
    "80F5C005": "Your performance reminds me of a number of Osiris's minor exploits. Far better than the average Guardian's! Perhaps I should write it down.",
    "80F5C007": "What a display of true power! You honor this place, and your efforts add to the great record of Osiris and those who act in his name.",
    "80F5C008": "Speaking as his most-published chronicler, I know Osiris would have done exactly as you just did. Amazing. Incredible. One might even say Osirian!",
    "80F5C009": "You are truly worthy to walk in Osiris's footsteps.",
    "80F5C00B": "Astonishing! It's rare to see a Guardian with such promise. You'd tell me if you were actually Osiris in disguise, wouldn't you?",
    "80F5C00D": "A Vex Mind has turned its thoughts toward our present reality.",
    "80F5C00E": "It is as Osiris predicted! A Vex Mind moves its servants between past and future!",
    "80F5C00F": "A crossroads in time has opened. The Vex are on the march.",
    "80F5C010": "The Vex slip between timelines like quicksilver. But you have one chance to stop them, right now.",
    "80F5C011": "The past is the future as the present is the past. Vex are on the move.",
    "80F5C013": "As Osiris predicted, it was. Yet, so shall it be again: next time the gatekeepers gather, you will win.",
    "80F5C014": "Well. May I suggest a closer look at Osiris's teachings on enemy tactics and engagement? I can recommend several volumes that would be helpful.",
    "80F5C015": "Osiris taught that we should be as the Vex: vigilant, relentless, and always evolving.",
    "80F5C016": "You will have another chance. The Vex will march again, and you will crush them. Or you will die. But I believe it will be the first one!",
    "80F5C017": "The Vex hold the keys to your success.",
    "80F5C018": "The final moment of reckoning, a chance to change fate",
    "80F5C019": "The time is now. Listen to the small Osiris voice in your head, as I do, and you will succeed.",
    "80F5C01A": "This is it! Strike down the Vex like Osiris would!",
    "80F5C01B": "And now we shall see if your efforts draw Osiris's attention to me! I mean—to us!",
    "80F5C01C": "The gatekeepers have fallen; the crossroads are still. A commendable effort.",
    "80F5C01D": "The crossroads are severed. You have denied the Vex passage.",
    "80F5C01F": "The Followers of Osiris will record your name.",
    "80F5C021": "Because of your efforts, the Vex have lost their path through time.",
    "80F5C022": "The tapestry of time is restored, thanks to you.",
    "80F5C023": "Seek glory against the Vex. Charge into battle like the mighty Osiris himself!",
    "80F5C024": "Your goal is to command where and when the Vex may go, just as Osiris has done.",
    "80F5C026": "These crossroads are a knot in the tapestry of time. You must unravel it.",
    "80F5C027": "You stand on a thread that links past and present, preparation and triumph.",
    "80F5C028": "Stand strong! Channel Osiris and destroy all heresies! Also, the Vex!",
    "80F5C029": "Outstanding! Keep it up, and you may someday even live up to Osiris's deeds.",
    "80F5C02A": "Ha! Such an amazing performance will surely draw Osiris back to the Lighthouse!",
    "80F5C02B": "You did not just sever the crossroads—you crushed your enemies. That's very Osiris of you.",
    "80F5C02D": "If more Guardians of your caliber came to Mercury, perhaps we would unravel all the mysteries of the Vex.",
    "80F5C02F": "I would not dare to speak for Osiris, but if I did, I know he would say this is an excellent display of skill and coordination.",
    "80F5C160": "I'm here to follow Osiris Vance not so much.",
    "80F5C163": "Listen, I know the Followers of Osiris are strange. But we possess the most comprehensive database on that Warlock outside of the City.",
    "80F5C164": "What do the Vex want? I'm not sure I'm qualified to say aside from all of us dead, that is.",
    "80F5C165": "I'm here to help however I can. But man, the Followers of Osiris are weird.",
    "80F5C166": "I don't always see eye to eye with Brother Vance. But he WAS the first one here.",
    "80F5C167": "I've been transcribing prophecies for Brother Vance for a long time now. I can't tell if he's crazy or if I am.",
    "80F5C168": "The thought had occurred to me that Osiris might not be real. I've never seen the man. But Vance never doubted.",
    "80F5C169": "Everything Brother Vance knows about Osiris we Followers have transcribed. What else does Vance know? Not that much.",
    "80F5C16A": "That can't be right. We just transcribed that yesterday.",
    "80F5C16B": "If it sounds insane, Brother Vance probably said it. And he's usually right.",
    "80F5C16C": "Did you say, 'simulated chicken'? I'm not transcribing that.",
    "80F5C16D": "I came here to learn Warlock history. Why is everyone so weird?",
    "80F5C16E": "I've been here for years, and this place still gives me the creeps. None of us belong here. Not really.",
    "80F5C16F": "I came here to learn about the Vex. What I found was Brother Vance and not a single legendary Warlock in sight.",
    "80F5C170": "What do I know about Osiris? Not much. He's never here. I can tell you a lot about Brother Vance.",
    "80F5C171": "According to Brother Vance, the City was holding Osiris back. He had to leave if he was going to reach his full potential.",
    "80F5C172": "According to legend, Osiris has fought the Vex his entire life. No one knows them better.",
    "80F5C173": "Vex ruins are my specialty. I'm not sure what Brother Vance's specialty is.",
    "80F5C174": "The Infinite Forest sounds like the most exotic Vex ruin in the system. And I'm stuck here.",
    "80F5C175": "I came here to learn from Osiris. I got Vance instead.",
    "80F5C176": "The Followers of Osiris? Yeah. We're as weird as we sound. Some of us are more aware of it than others.",
    "80F5C177": "Brother Vance's predictions have a knack for becoming true—only reason I stick around.",
    "80F5C178": "When you take a prediction engine away from the Vex, what do they have left?",
    "80F5C179": "You've done more for the cause than any of us ever have. Thank you.",
    "80F5C17A": "Vance should respect you more. The rest of us do immensely.",
    "80F5C17B": "I hope Osiris appreciates you as much as his Followers do.",
    "80F5C17C": "With everything you've done and all that you've seen, I think the Forest could still show you something new.",
    "80F5C17D": "Be careful out there. They say the Forest can create anything.",
    "80F5C17E": "I know the exact moment in time and space I'd go back to visit if I could enter the Forest. Do you?",
    "80F5C17F": "They say the simulations in the Forest are perfect replicas. Could it create a perfect copy of you?",
    "80F5C180": "That can't be right, can it?",
    "80F5C181": "Sounds ridiculous.",
    "80F5C182": "I'll investigate.",
    "80F5C183": "Something to look into.",
    "80F5C184": "Why?",
    "80F5C185": "That should be it.",
    "80F5C186": "Say that again?",
    "80F5C187": "That makes no sense.",
    "80F5C188": "Brother Vance is the one you want. Sorry.",
    "80F5C189": "Brother Vance has the answers you need.",
    "80F5C18A": "If you seek Osiris, speak to Brother Vance.",
    "80F5C18B": "No time to talk. Brother Vance can help you.",
    "80F5C18C": "Talk to Vance. Just know this place isn't all it's cracked up to be.",
    "80F5C18D": "I don't have the answers you're looking for. Talk to Vance.",
    "80F5C18E": "You're the hero Vance keeps talking about. What did you see out there in the Forest?",
    "80F5C190": "Brother Vance said he has nothing more to teach you now that Panoptes is gone. I think you should be teaching Vance.",
    "80F5C191": "You met Osiris? Did he live up to the legend?",
    "80F5C193": "Vance said you walk the pathways of the Forest. Be careful out there.",
    "80F5C194": "They say the Forest contains gateways to every possible variant of our universe, as simulated by the Vex. Are they right?",
    "80F5C195": "You come and go from the Forest all the time. How do you keep track of what's real?",
    "80F5C197": "Ikora says she has rejected Osiris's teachings? No. If you ask me, she learned too well.",
    "80F5C19A": "It takes real resolve to follow Osiris. Sometimes I still feel the pull of the Reef—but I resist. All that is imperfect must burn away.",
    "80F5C19B": "I followed Brother Vance when he left the Reef. And if he leaves Mercury, I'll follow him again.",
    "80F5C19C": "Yes, Osiris spoke with the Awoken Queen, but their conversations were not recorded.",
    "80F5C19D": "If the Infinite Forest simulates all possible realities is there a reality where I don't follow Osiris?",
    "80F5C19E": "Has the Forest revealed to Osiris why people like me are the way we are?",
    "80F5C19F": "I believe Osiris would want me to pursue the mysteries of the Awoken.",
    "80F5C1A0": "Is there a reality where Queen Mara still lives? I would like to see it.",
    "80F5C1A1": "Don't let the Future War Cult have this data.",
    "80F5C1A2": "Petra Venj has no right to ask that of us.",
    "80F5C1A3": "I'll check the library, but I doubt it.",
    "80F5C1A4": "You can never be sure, with prophecies.",
    "80F5C1A5": "Sagira can be an, er untrustworthy narrator.",
    "80F5C1A6": "Osiris teaches me that I can be stronger. Stronger than my mind stronger than the voices",
    "80F5C1A7": "I will remove all weakness from myself.",
    "80F5C1A8": "I thought the Speaker had these manuscripts destroyed. Someone must have rescued them.",
    "80F5C1A9": "Ulan-Tan was very inspired by Osiris.",
    "80F5C1AA": "Osiris would never have been banished if the Concordat were still in power.",
    "80F5C1AB": "Osiris's banishment was inevitable. Ikora Rey would have been wrong to intercede.",
    "80F5C1AC": "If the City isn't ready for his teachings, then they will die. Not even the Guardians can protect them.",
    "80F5C1AD": "Lord Shaxx knows his Parables. You can just tell.",
    "80F5C1AE": "Did Osiris send a message with you, by any chance?",
    "80F5C1AF": "I would like to see Osiris. Just once.",
    "80F5C1B0": "Sagira is back with Osiris, then. Do you miss her?",
    "80F5C1B1": "I've never heard of a Ghost and Guardian parting like Sagira and Osiris did. Could it happen again?",
    "80F5C1B3": "Saint-14 had strength of body, but he lacked strength of mind.",
    "80F5C1B4": "The Infinite Forest can only react to reality. Our actions will always shape its future.",
    "80F5C1B5": "If Osiris demands perfect knowledge but the Infinite Forest is, well, infinite does that mean perfection is impossible?",
    "80F5C1B6": "Yes, the Infinite Forest can show Humanity's past. Many possible versions of the past, in fact.",
    "80F5C1B7": "Hahaha! Wait, really?",
    "80F5C1B8": "I see. I see. I don't see.",
    "80F5C1B9": "Go on.",
    "80F5C1BA": "Perhaps I'm mistaken.",
    "80F5C1BB": "Wait, back up. What?",
    "80F5C1BC": "Indeed.",
    "80F5C1BD": "Well.",
    "80F5C1BE": "[sigh]",
    "80F5C1BF": "The keepers of the Lighthouse greet you.",
    "80F5C1C0": "Welcome to the Lighthouse.",
    "80F5C1C2": "Do you have word from the Reef?",
    "80F5C1C3": "Sun's blessings upon you.",
    "80F5C1C4": "You journeyed far to reach this place.",
    "80F5C1C5": "It's a hot one out there, isn't it?",
    "80F5C1C6": "Do you ever wonder if Osiris knew all of this would happen? That you would give him such great power?",
    "80F5C1C7": "The Guardian of prophecy walks among us!",
    "80F5C1C9": "Your legend continues to grow, Guardian.",
    "80F5C1CB": "From now on, when people tell Osiris's story, they will mention you.",
    "80F5C1CC": "What news from Osiris?",
    "80F5C1CE": "Do the Vex take pleasure in the chaos they sow? Or are they driven entirely by machine code?",
    "80F5C1D1": "If a Vex simulation shares all the physical elements of the genuine article, then what's the difference?",
    "80F5C1D2": "The Followers of Osiris fear the Vex more than anything, so we immerse ourselves in their study. My life is built on anxiety.",
    "80F5C1D3": "If the Vex succeed in their goals, what then? Where do they go from there? Do they wonder the same?",
    "80F5C1D4": "Every Vex simulation is a question that Osiris must prevent them from asking.",
    "80F5C1D5": "Brother Vance contends the Vex can create perfect simulations of any point in time and space. How do you plan for an enemy like that?",
    "80F5C1D6": "They say when the red star rises, the end will come.",
    "80F5C1D7": "What is the end? The end is a world of machines. A world of the dead.",
    "80F5C1D8": "I've already told you. What the Vex intend only Osiris can prevent.",
    "80F5C1D9": "No, the twenty-third prophecy is the one where the Vex control our dreams. You're thinking of number seven.",
    "80F5C1DA": "That's right. The Vex are biological creatures. Only their shells are machines.",
    "80F5C1DB": "The most important trait of a Follower of Osiris? It's knowing that we know nothing.",
    "80F5C1DC": "The work Osiris performs is to lay the foundation for the future.",
    "80F5C1DD": "Brother Vance is the prophet, and Osiris is the future.",
    "80F5C1DE": "The Followers of Osiris record the deeds of Osiris as told by Brother Vance.",
    "80F5C1DF": "If half the stories about Osiris are true, the Vex are doomed.",
    "80F5C1E0": "Brother Vance seems to know Osiris personally. I wonder how they would have met. I've never asked.",
    "80F5C1E1": "I didn't know my eyes could feel tired. But I've never written this much in my life.",
    "80F5C1E2": "I haven't slept in a week. Brother Vance has been prolific the last few days.",
    "80F5C1E3": "I don't fear the Vex. Not so long as Osiris stands between us and them.",
    "80F5C1E4": "Panoptes, defeated! Brother Vance is exuberant.",
    "80F5C1E5": "The Infinite Forest belongs to Osiris. But what dark future are we hurtling toward now?",
    "80F5C1E6": "The Infinite Mind is gone? Has the crisis passed?",
    "80F5C1E7": "I hope Osiris is as relieved as Brother Vance regarding our— your victory.",
    "80F5C1E8": "With you traversing the pathways of the Forest, we can all rest a little easier.",
    "80F5C1E9": "Brother Vance tells me we have you to thank for the fall of Panoptes.",
    "80F5C1EA": "I envy you. Not for your power, but your freedom to follow in Osiris's footsteps.",
    "80F5C1EB": "I hope Osiris appreciates your work. I know I do.",
    "80F5C1EC": "We'll see about that.",
    "80F5C1ED": "What now?",
    "80F5C1EE": "As foretold.",
    "80F5C1EF": "As expected.",
    "80F5C1F0": "Unlikely.",
    "80F5C1F1": "Anything is possible.",
    "80F5C1F2": "Never enough time.",
    "80F5C1F3": "Every day a new prophecy.",
    "80F5C1F4": "Truth and wisdom. Both necessary. And difficult to obtain.",
    "80F5C1F5": "It's likely I shall never meet the blessed Osiris. But as long as he continues his work, I am content.",
    "80F5C1F6": "With you here, I pray the great one has everything he needs to defeat the Vex.",
    "80F5C1F7": "You'll want to speak with Brother Vance. He'll have the answers you seek.",
    "80F5C1F8": "Brother Vance possesses a direct connection to Osiris, the great one himself. Vance is a powerful man.",
    "80F5C1F9": "The work Brother Vance can't get to, I finish. It is my honor.",
    "80F5C1FA": "I've heard we have you to thank for the defeat of Panoptes.",
    "80F5C1FB": "Brother Vance tells me you've averted a terrible future. May you fight forever.",
    "80F5C1FD": "You have the thanks of my brothers and sisters. For all you've done.",
    "80F5C1FF": "Thanks to your heroism, the great Osiris can now focus his attention on what truly matters: the Forest.",
    "80F5C200": "The Infinite Forest. What will you find in its depths, now that Panoptes has been defeated and you are free to explore?",
    "80F5C201": "I'm sure Osiris appreciates what you've done. Brother Vance certainly does.",
    "80F5C203": "They used to say Osiris was dangerous. But he was showing us where the real danger lay.",
    "80F5C206": "My family told me I was stupid for leaving home to follow the cult of a dead traitor. But Osiris is alive, and he will save us.",
    "80F5C207": "We lost so many brothers and sisters in the war. I thought Osiris would return then, to save us.",
    "80F5C208": "We thought we could find the right Guardian with the Trials. We were wrong.",
    "80F5C20A": "I can't believe that so many people still think it's safe to hide under an alien artifact. Osiris told us of the dangers long ago.",
    "80F5C20B": "History is full of bright minds committed to understanding the Vex. I believe Maya Sundaresh was the brightest of them all.",
    "80F5C20C": "Let's discuss this later.",
    "80F5C20D": "Yes, I believe you're right.",
    "80F5C20E": "No. That's incorrect.",
    "80F5C20F": "WWOT: What Would Osiris Think?",
    "80F5C210": "If that's what you think",
    "80F5C211": "How curious. Go on.",
    "80F5C212": "The Speaker sent Saint-14 to find Osiris. But he was not worthy. Perhaps we, too, are not worthy.",
    "80F5C213": "It says here, 'We are in a logic of simulation, which no longer has anything to do with a logic of facts and an order of reason.'",
    "80F5C214": "Osiris has seen so much now. He knows more than we ever could. So, is it cruelty or wisdom that stops him from sharing his knowledge with us? I fear it's cruelty.",
    "80F5C215": "Solipsism is the most boring metaphysical position that one might take. And yet, it often seems truest to me.",
    "80F5C216": "I have wondered whether our presence here was preordained by Osiris, or by the Vex. Surely something commands our destiny.",
    "80F5C217": "So the Traveler is 'awake,' is it? It has done nothing for centuries. I don't expect it will do much now.",
    "80F5C218": "The Chosen One walks among us, and yet Osiris remains absent. I fear we have done something wrong, that we have been untrue.",
    "80F5C21A": "If Osiris will not come to the Lighthouse, then perhaps he could send Sagira. Anything is better than nothing. We need guidance.",
    "80F5C21B": "I spent some time in the EDZ after the attack on the City. The Followers there were among the most faithful.",
    "80F5C21C": "I was at the temple in the EDZ. When Vance called me to serve here, he saved my life.",
    "80F5C21D": "In the Parables of the Allspring, it says the light will always outshine the dark.",
    "80F5C21E": "Osiris would say we should stay the course.",
    "80F5C21F": "Osiris would say that your first instinct is usually correct.",
    "80F5C220": "Osiris would say that no matter how difficult something is, we cannot stop trying.",
    "80F5C221": "If the Infinite Forest is different every time you enter, how do you ever find your way out again?",
    "80F5C222": "The paths to the Infinite Forest are open, and still Osiris does not use them to visit us.",
    "80F5C223": "Someday I will enter the Infinite Forest and become one with eternity.",
    "80F5C224": "I will be like Osiris. One day, I will enter the Forest and never return.",
    "80F5C225": "Mmm.",
    "80F5C226": "Uh-huh.",
    "80F5C227": "I see.",
    "80F5C228": "Ah'",
    "80F5C229": "Huh.",
    "80F5C22A": "Go on.",
    "80F5C22B": "Ah!",
    "80F5C22C": "Mm-hmm.",
    "80F5C22D": "Ah, the Chosen One. I am humbled to greet you.",
    "80F5C22F": "Have you come to study the path?",
    "80F5C231": "Welcome. Your business is with Brother Vance, I'm sure.",
    "80F5C233": "If you have business with Brother Vance, he is not far.",
    "80F5C234": "The Lighthouse welcomes you.",
    "80F5C236": "Blessings of Osiris be upon you.",
    "80F5C237": "So you've met Osiris? Huh! I wish we were all so lucky.",
    "80F5C239": "Tell me, is Osiris everything that the legends say he is?",
    "80F5C23A": "Are you here to join the Followers, Chosen One?",
    "80F5C23C": "I hear you may venture into the Infinite Forest again. Is it true?",
    "80F5C23D": "I would not toy with Vex simulations if I were you.",
    "80F5C23E": "Take care not to lose yourself when you delve into the infinite.",
    "80F5C240": "I have seen signs of dangers ahead. Are you ready?",
    "80F5C244": "The Followers of Osiris require your assistance.",
    "80F5C245": "I need— I mean, OSIRIS needs your help.",
    "80F5C246": "There is a message from the Voice of Wisdom. She says your help is required.",
    "80F5C247": "A message has come from the Infinite Forest. It is for you.",
    "80F5C248": "We have need of a Guardian.",
    "80F5C24A": "We have a task only a Guardian can accomplish.",
    "80F5C24C": "Our enemies are moving against us.",
    "80F5C24D": "The Followers of Osiris need your help.",
    "80F5C24E": "I have a task for a Guardian. Are you prepared?",
    "80F5C250": "Do you need something?",
    "80F5C251": "Osiris is a Guardian of action. I see that you are different.",
    "80F5C252": "I know you're still there, Guardian. Nice try.",
    "80F5C254": "If you do not know what you want, Osiris can give you clarity.",
    "80F5C255": "I treat even those who don't know as much about Osiris as I do with politeness and charity.",
    "80F5C256": "We held the Trials to find the Guardian who could pass through the gate and find Osiris. None succeeded, not even me.",
    "80F5C258": "I used to think I too could be a Guardian. Even called myself a Warlock. I was wrong, but it was my path to a better calling.",
    "80F5C259": "I have given my life to Osiris, and my sight. And he can't even give me a moment of his time!",
    "80F5C25A": "Who knows Osiris better than I do? No one. Not even that annoying Ghost of his.",
    "80F5C25B": "Sagira said this, Sagira said that If she is so great, why did Osiris send her away?",
    "80F5C25D": "Every day I ask myself, what would Osiris do? And the answer is always the same: Osiris would do the most amazing things all the time.",
    "80F5C25E": "Osiris could see what the other Vanguard could not. He tried to warn us—and was exiled. You are all unworthy of his greatness.",
    "80F5C25F": "The Infinite Forest. I need to go. I need to experience it for myself. And Osiris he will be there. He will be there, and he will notice me.",
    "80F5C260": "For some reason, writing a book about the Infinite Forest is taking a really, really long time.",
    "80F5C261": "The signs are aligning—portents that point to a time when Osiris will speak to his most faithful. He will recognize my devotion in particular.",
    "80F5C263": "Osiris will return. And when he does, he will answer all my questions, and thank me. He might even give me a nickname.",
    "80F5C264": "Are you waiting for something? Osiris's return, perhaps?",
    "80F5C265": "Take all the time you want. It's not as if I have things to do. Books to write, Followers to organize No, it's fine.",
    "80F5C266": "Osiris may have written the first Parables, but others were added later. I wrote the very popular twenty-seven-part series, 'The Ninth Promise,' which I believe is the definitive version of what happened when Osiris met the Nine.",
    "80F5C267": "I gave my sight to Osiris, because I believed I could be his champion. I would give anything for him.",
    "80F5C268": "I have held things Osiris touched. Walked paths he walked. There are moments when I can almost sense his presence. It brings me peace, but also a terrible longing.",
    "80F5C269": "I feel the sun, and it is as bright and powerful as Osiris. He is the sun to us.",
    "80F5C26A": "Your kind doesn't normally keep me waiting, Hunter. Do you have something to say?",
    "80F5C26C": "The fifth virtue, according to Osiris, is patience. I will wait.",
    "80F5C26D": "I know you are still here, Hunter. Perhaps you should practice your stealth.",
    "80F5C26F": "Your commander was instrumental in exiling Osiris, He Who Knows All and Understands Eternity. What could Zavala know that Osiris does not?",
    "80F5C270": "If you think the Followers will forgive the City for how they treated our leader, you are mistaken.",
    "80F5C272": "Ikora was Osiris's greatest student. And she turned on him. It was the ultimate betrayal.",
    "80F5C273": "I wanted to be a Warlock once",
    "80F5C274": "When I stare off into space, I tell people I am contemplating Osiris's wisdom. Perhaps that is what you are doing now.",
    "80F5C275": "Let us speak of truth and wisdom.",
    "80F5C276": "Ah! Another searcher appears, no doubt seeking an advance copy of my next book about Osiris!",
    "80F5C278": "Do you feel the sun? It burns away all that we do not need.",
    "80F5C279": "Osiris taught us that we must be patient, loyal, and stalwart. I am all three to an exceptional degree.",
    "80F5C27A": "Osiris speaks to Guardians, but not to his most loyal servants. At least, not yet.",
    "80F5C27B": "I once heard the blessed Sagira say that Osiris does not regard his Followers as worthy of his attention. She is wrong.",
    "80F5C27C": "My purpose is to share the wisdom of Osiris. Do you wish to learn?",
    "80F5C27E": "You have come seeking truth. I can give it to you.",
    "80F5C280": "Let us speak of what is to come.",
    "80F5C281": "I record everything, so that all may learn of Osiris's glory.",
    "80F5C282": "I can tell you have many questions. You have come to the right place. The answer is 'Osiris.'",
    "80F5C283": "A sharp blade. A sure step. Come closer, Hunter.",
    "80F5C285": "Hunter, you have learned well the lessons of the stalker. Approach.",
    "80F5C287": "A Hunter such as you could learn much from Osiris's teachings.",
    "80F5C289": "I see with more than my eyes, Hunter.",
    "80F5C28B": "A heavy tread. The weight of the world on your shoulders. Come closer, Titan.",
    "80F5C28D": "Saint-14 would be pleased to meet one such as you, Titan.",
    "80F5C28F": "A Titan such as you could learn much from Osiris's teachings.",
    "80F5C291": "Come closer, Warlock. We have much to discuss.",
    "80F5C293": "Do you feel the warmth of Osiris's Light, Warlock?",
    "80F5C295": "Light steps. The scent of ozone. Come closer, Warlock.",
    "80F5C297": "I used to believe I would be the one to find Osiris. That's not my calling—apparently.",
    "80F5C298": "The Vanguard called Osiris a heretic. Said he had turned away from the Light. They closed their ears, and would not hear the truth. And now look who's come crawling back?",
    "80F5C299": "I have detailed accounts of the events of Osiris's exile in my third book, 'The Betrayal of the Vanguard.' I was not there, of course, but I am certain I've captured their foolishness perfectly.",
    "80F5C29A": "Ikora Rey once sat at the feet of our leader. Now she thinks she is above him. Don't make me laugh! No one is above him.",
    "80F5C29B": "Infinity waits outside this place. Are you enough like Osiris to seize it?",
    "80F5C29C": "Sometimes I think Osiris would be better served by a loyal companion than a Ghost. I wonder why he hasn't seen that yet.",
    "80F5C29D": "The Traveler wakes. It is an evil portent.",
    "80F5C29E": "I have heard the booming echo of Osiris's words in a way no one else has. I bet there's nobody here who can quote his Fifth Homily.",
    "80F5C29F": "There are two types of people in the world: those who follow Osiris, and those who haven't read his teachings yet.",
    "80F5C2A0": "You'd test your will against a true Follower of Osiris? Please!",
    "80F5C2A2": "I held the Trials in service to Osiris. Now I keep a vigil for his return.",
    "80F5C2A3": "The Queen once whispered a secret to me. I know one day I'll share it with Osiris.",
    "80F5C2A4": "The Parables speak to what could be. We must find what is.",
    "80F5C2A5": "Ah, Guardian. The portents told me you would return today.",
    "80F5C2A7": "Osiris said to purify oneself by burning away all distraction. I see by your presence here that I'm not quite done with that stage yet.",
    "80F5C2A8": "The truth awaits you, Guardian. Whenever you're ready.",
    "80F5C2AA": "You have come seeking the wisdom of Osiris.",
    "80F5C2AC": "Approach and be heard. Speak, and tell me what wisdom you seek.",
    "80F5C2AE": "If you need more time, Guardian, take it.",
    "80F5C2B0": "You seek knowledge. There is time to learn.",
    "80F5C2B1": "I know many things. One of them is that Guardians have no respect for my time.",
    "80F5C2B2": "Greetings, Guardian.",
    "80F5C2B4": "What have you done for Osiris today?",
    "80F5C2B6": "Back again, Guardian?",
    "80F5C2B8": "The signs heralded your approach.",
    "80F5C2B9": "Hello, Guardian.",
    "80F5C2BB": "The Followers welcome you, Guardian.",
    "80F5C2BD": "Welcome to the Lighthouse.",
    "80F5C2BF": "Have you come to learn more about Osiris?",
    "80F5C2C0": "Do you bring a message from Osiris?",
    "80F5C2C1": "Ah, Chosen of Sagira. What can I do for you?",
    "80F5C2C3": "Back from the Infinite Forest? I imagine Osiris spoke of me often",
    "80F5C2C4": "Osiris has been found—the signs were true! Just as I knew all along.",
    "80F5C2C5": "You have done great things, Guardian. Wondrous things.",
    "80F5C2C7": "I will mention you in my next book. My working title is: 'The One Who Was Chosen, and the One Who Watches Who Is Also Very Good.'",
    "80F5C2C9": "You don't have Sagira with you? Disappointing. I have so many questions for her, and she does not respond to my messages.",
    "80F5C2CA": "I feel like I should give you a name now. Something for the Osiris historians. The Chosen? The One Who Found Osiris? The One Ikora Sent to Do Her Job for Her?",
    "80F5C2CC": "You must tell me everything about the Infinite Forest. Everything. I will give you infinite time to tell me.",
    "80F5C2CD": "The signs pointed to your return this day.",
    "80F5C2CE": "As long as the sun shines, the Followers will hold this place in his name.",
    "80F5C2CF": "Was was Osiris pleased with me? Did he mention me at all?",
    "80F5C2D0": "If Osiris were here, I know he would be pleased with your efforts against the Vex.",
    "80F5C2D1": "The Vex are constantly searching for a way to shape reality. You have stopped them for now.",
    "80F5C2D2": "When I awoke this morning, the portents were not good. But then you arrived, and I saw that they were in error.",
    "80F5C2D4": "You have changed infinity. Tell me: has it changed you, too?",
    "80F5C2D6": "You will be a footnote in my next work on Osiris's travels in the Infinite Forest. An important footnote.",
    "80F5C2D7": "All that time in the Infinite Forest, and you never considered taking someone in with you? Someone who would greatly like to meet Osiris?",
    "80F5C2D8": "You do the work that Osiris cannot be bothered with. It is very important work.",
    "80F5C2D9": "Osiris is guarding all of time and reality. We do what is required.",
    "80F5C2DA": "I had hoped that more Followers would join us to record the wonders of the Infinite Forest. You have told people about what happened, haven't you?",
    "80F5C2DC": "I will show you the shape of truth. And yes, it is shaped like Osiris.",
    "80F5C2DD": "Dark omens rise on the red star.",
    "80F5C2DE": "Osiris has given me, his greatest student, a message. It simply says: 'Fight.'",
    "80F5C2DF": "I have endured many trials. The wait for Osiris to return is yet another.",
    "80F5C2E0": "I don't need to see you, Guardian, to know you seek the truth of Osiris. We all do.",
    "80F5C2E2": "My knowledge will change the world. I will tell everyone of my— I mean, Osiris's wisdom.",
    "80F5C2E3": "I can see why you'd want that.",
    "80F5C2E4": "You'll be able to make better use of that than I did.",
    "80F5C2E5": "Not what I would have chosen, but",
    "80F5C2E6": "I hope this serves you well.",
    "80F5C2E7": "Interesting choice.",
    "80F5C2E8": "Unorthodox, but it could be useful.",
    "80F5C2E9": "Use it as Osiris would, Guardian.",
    "80F5C2EB": "You'll be able to help Osiris using that.",
    "80F5C2EC": "That will give you a very Osiris-like aspect. It's a good look.",
    "80F5C2EE": "Hmm. Not what Osiris would have chosen.",
    "80F5C2EF": "In Osiris's name.",
    "80F5C2F0": "With thanks from the Followers of Osiris.",
    "80F5C2F1": "Remember Osiris when you use that.",
    "80F5C2F2": "Yes! NOW you're thinking like a Follower of Osiris.",
    "80F5C2F4": "Osiris has one just like that. Me too, actually.",
    "80F5C2F5": "I think Osiris would be pleased with your choice.",
    "80F5C2F6": "You felt Osiris guiding your hand toward that, yes? Excellent choice.",
    "80F5C2F8": "You don't see those often.",
    "80F5C2F9": "You knew right away that Osiris used one just like this. You've been reading my books, I can tell!",
    "80F5C2FB": "Osiris would've chosen the exact same item. You're learning.",
    "80F5C2FD": "That will serve you well in the Infinite Forest.",
    "80F5C2FE": "Osiris's blessings upon you.",
    "80F5C2FF": "Do as Osiris would in all things, and you'll never be wrong.",
    "80F5C301": "Consider the teachings of the Wise One in all things.",
    "80F5C302": "Be well.",
    "80F5C303": "Osiris be with you, and also with me.",
    "80F5C304": "May Osiris's Light be with you.",
    "80F5C305": "Follow Osiris in all things, Hunter.",
    "80F5C307": "Consider the mysteries, Hunter.",
    "80F5C309": "Fight with Osiris's strength.",
    "80F5C30A": "You honor the legacy of Osiris, Titan.",
    "80F5C30C": "You are not Osiris, but you are worthy, Warlock.",
    "80F5C30E": "Be well, Warlock.",
    "80F5C310": "Only a Guardian could have accomplished that.",
    "80F5C312": "There are things only your Light can do.",
    "80F5C313": "Excellent. Did Osiris thank me for sending you? N–Never mind.",
    "80F5C315": "My brothers and sisters thank you.",
    "80F5C316": "Once again, you help us to avert cosmic disaster.",
    "80F5C318": "I may never meet Osiris, but I can see why he values you.",
    "80F5C319": "Perhaps, one day, you'll rival Osiris himself.",
    "80F5C31A": "You are ever a light in the darkness.",
    "80F5C32E": "A Minotaur. Are they trying to keep us out, or him in?",
    "80F5C331": "Both? Take out the Mind, take down the gate. It's true in pretty much every reality.",
    "80F5C332": "Saint-14 must have been here for years. Decades. He ran out of ammo, and justkept fighting.",
    "80F5C333": "Yes! I have a reading on Saint-14's location. Hold on, we're coming for you.",
    "80F5C334": "Bring him back to us, Guardian. Saint-14 is a primary source for the early Osiris years. He will be able to settle some let's call them 'differences of opinion in which one side is wrong.'",
    "80F5C336": "We'll get right on that, Vance",
    "80F5C337": "Got him!",
    "80F5C338": "There! The signal is coming from beyond that gate.",
    "80F5C339": "What happened?",
    "80F5C33A": "Vex. Thousands of them.",
    "80F5C33B": "This is all that's left. We should take it back to the Lighthouse.",
    "80F5C33C": "Goodbye",
    "80F5C33D": "If Saint-14 has been lost all this time, do you think he's OK?",
    "80F5C33E": "Nothing could stop that old Exo. Probably lecturing a Vex? Titan lectures—long speeches, occasional punching. ",
    "80F5C33F": "Should be fine.",
    "80F5C340": "If Saint-14 was threatened, he would attack. And he would not have known how easy it is to be cast adrift in these realities.",
    "80F5C341": "Then we'll find him and bring him home.",
    "80F5C342": "And it moved. Definitely a temporal disruption.",
    "80F5C343": "This place looks inviting.",
    "80F5C344": "Oh. Yeah. You missed our first trip here. Vex are quite the decorators, aren't they?",
    "80F5C345": "Saint's Light it's gone.",
    "80F5C346": "Rest in peace, my friend.",
    "80F5C347": "Osiris I'm so sorry.",
    "80F5C348": "I… I think we should leave him here. It looks like the Infinite Forest laid him to rest. Built him a memorial. Did the Vex learn to respect him?",
    "80F5C349": "I don't think I ever told you this, but Saint-14 was one of the first Guardians I ever met, even before I found you. I always hoped you'd turn out like him. I wasn't disappointed.",
    "80F5C34B": "You were a good friend, Saint. Goodbye.",
    "80F5C390": "Get me to the conflux, and I'll plug in the processor.",
    "80F5C393": "Those Vex were patrolling here for a reason. Let's keep looking around.",
    "80F5C394": "We've been so focused on the threat of the future What if the answer lies in the past?",
    "80F5C395": "If you found the code that created Panoptes, you could use the Infinite Forest against the Vex.",
    "80F5C396": "…YES. We go back to the moment that led to Panoptes, run time forward, and use THAT data to find its location in the present! Oh, that's good, Ikora. Osiris-level good.",
    "80F5C397": "You know, you're not the same Ikora I remember. You're better.",
    "80F5C398": "One of my Hidden has located an Entangled Mind for you. That class of Vex Mind should provide the processing power you need.",
    "80F5C399": "Great. We'll find it and take its brain.",
    "80F5C39A": "I hope this does the trick.",
    "80F5C39B": "I think we're on the right track.",
    "80F5C39C": "Excellent, this is our processor. I just need to connect it to the Vex network.",
    "80F5C39D": "You're near the Well of Echoes.",
    "80F5C39E": "Right. The confluxes there should work.",
    "80F5C39F": "That's the Vex we need. Go get it.",
    "80F5C3A0": "Bad news—the processor shorted out. I'm getting an image, but no coordinates. I'm out of ideas here.",
    "80F5C3A1": "O-ho-ho-ho-no. We found you once. You're not getting away!",
    "80F5C428": "There's Kargen!",
    "80F5C42B": "I'm pretty sure he realizes we're not going to let him get away with stealing the data while we're here.",
    "80F5C42C": "You are correct, Friendly Ghost. A massive buildup of energy indicates several Cabal transports are inbound to your position.",
    "80F5C42D": "You asked for it.",
    "80F5C42E": "Guardian, we've received limited intel regarding a Vex information depot. ",
    "80F5C430": "I want you to get in there and figure out what they know.",
    "80F5C431": "Greetings, Captain! Commander Zavala has requested that I run tactical on this mission.",
    "80F5C433": "Please allow me to help you with your invasion of the Insight Terminus.",
    "80F5C434": "Hello, Failsafe. You're familiar with this place?",
    "80F5C435": "Oh yes, quite! The Vex were very active there when the Exodus Black first arrived on Nessus.",
    "80F5C436": "The Vex that murdered my crew came from there. ",
    "80F5C437": "I'm sorry that you have to relive those memories.",
    "80F5C438": "It's all right. It's only taken me a few centuries to suppress them.",
    "80F5C439": "Oh, hello, Failsafe. What can you tell us about this Terminus?",
    "80F5C43A": "I have not detected significant Vex activity in that area since shortly after the Exodus Black arrived.",
    "80F5C43B": "Well, that's good news. Maybe we won't run into much resistance.",
    "80F5C43C": "Yeah, but since Death kinda follows you around, I wouldn't count on that.",
    "80F5C43D": "Positive as ever, I see.",
    "80F5C43E": "Here they come again.",
    "80F5C43F": "Firewall in place. That should slow him down.",
    "80F5C440": "I injected some bad variables into his decryption process. That should slow him down.  ",
    "80F5C441": "One down, two to go",
    "80F5C443": "Wow! OK, don't get hit by that.",
    "80F5C445": "Intercepted communication from the Vex indicates that Kargen has bypassed their initial security protocols.",
    "80F5C446": "It looks like Kargen is using that conflux to access the data artifact.",
    "80F5C447": "Get me over to that Vex plate and I'll try a counter-hack.",
    "80F5C448": "I have good news",
    "80F5C449": "…and bad news.",
    "80F5C44A": "Give us the good news first.",
    "80F5C44B": "The good news is that you can expect only a few Vex as you approach the entrance to the Terminus.",
    "80F5C44C": "That is good news. What's the bad news?",
    "80F5C44D": "Courtesy of this Kargen guy, the Vex you do encounter will be headless suicide machines.",
    "80F5C44E": "Have fun.",
    "80F5C44F": "The good news is that Kargen is killing Vex by the dozen.",
    "80F5C450": "All right. What's the bad news?",
    "80F5C451": "Kargen has almost complete control over the Vex gate network. I predict several detachments of Cabal over the next few minutes.",
    "80F5C452": "Wonderful.",
    "80F5C453": "According to the Vex, Kargen has almost complete control over the local Vex gate network.",
    "80F5C454": "I predict several detachments of Cabal over the next few minutes.",
    "80F5C455": "No, I said give us the good news first.",
    "80F5C456": "I did.",
    "80F5C457": "The psion was wearing commander regalia.",
    "80F5C458": "Friendly Ghost, the Vex believe that commander is Kargen, an elite Red Legion psion.",
    "80F5C459": "And a particularly murderous one at that.",
    "80F5C45A": "We always get the fun ones.",
    "80F5C45B": "They say 'like attracts like,' you know.",
    "80F5C45C": "That guy looked like a commander of some sort.",
    "80F5C45D": "That's correct, Friendly Ghost!",
    "80F5C45E": "That commander was Kargen, an elite Cabal psion who has caused significant damage to the Vex collective in this timestream.",
    "80F5C45F": "This sounds bad.",
    "80F5C460": "Guardian, I'm making the elimination of Kargen your priority on this operation.",
    "80F5C462": "His crew has been active all over the system. From our intel, he's mostly targeting Vex installations.",
    "80F5C463": "However, removing him can only strengthen our position. Put him down.",
    "80F5C464": "There's got to be a way to get through here.",
    "80F5C465": "Failsafe, any ideas?",
    "80F5C466": "I believe Centurions will possess the means to remove the Vex block and grant you ingress.",
    "80F5C467": "One does have to admire Kargen's command of Vex technology.",
    "80F5C468": "Kargen is getting dangerously skilled at manipulating this Vex architecture.",
    "80F5C469": "Maybe if we catch him, he can give Cayde a lesson or two.",
    "80F5C46A": "Location secured, Commander Zavala.",
    "80F5C46B": "Good work, Guardian. What intel did you discover?",
    "80F5C46D": "Hmm, there's only one data artifact here, labeled 'OXA,'and it's seriously corrupted. Metadata says it was last accessed by an 'Otzot' centuries ago.",
    "80F5C46E": "What is 'OXA,' and who is 'Otzot'?",
    "80F5C46F": "There's an almost unreadable data artifact here, labeled 'OXA.' ",
    "80F5C470": "It's heavily corrupted, but I'm able to make out 'MSund12' from the access log. ",
    "80F5C471": "What is 'OXA,' and who was 'MSund12'?",
    "80F5C472": "You keep doing that and he's really gonna want you dead. Just saying.",
    "80F5C473": "Second protocol in place, but he's getting faster.",
    "80F5C474": "This guy is good. But we're better.",
    "80F5C475": "Those are questions for another day, I suppose. But for now, well done.",
    "80F5C476": "Red Legion? What are the Cabal doing here?",
    "80F5C477": "I am monitoring Vex transmissions. It appears that the Vex are repelling a Cabal incursion at your present location.",
    "80F5C478": "Yes, but what are they doing here?",
    "80F5C479": "The Vex are currently calculating probabilities to that question. Response will be forthcoming!",
    "80F5C47A": "Captain, a word of caution. I have been monitoring Vex transmissions. It appears the Vex are repelling a Cabal incursion at your present location.",
    "80F5C47C": "Any idea what they're doing down here?",
    "80F5C47D": "The Vex are currently calculating probabilities to that question. Response will be forthcoming!",
    "80F5C47E": "Whatever it is, you just know it's not good.",
    "80F5C47F": "Red Legion? Great, the Cabal are here.",
    "80F5C480": "Correct. I have been monitoring Vex transmissions.  The Cabal are invading the installation as well.",
    "80F5C481": "Gotta love coincidence.",
    "80F5C482": "Excellent work, Captain. You are at 50 percent completion of this task.",
    "80F5C484": "Nice work, Captain, but you're gonna need one more.",
    "80F5C486": "All right! We need one more. Keep an eye out for another Cabal drop or Centurion.",
    "80F5C500": "In the old days, kings were made by such discoveries. Swords in stones, and all that. New Monarchy will use this carefully.",
    "80F5C503": "Perhaps this strange material will be useful to us as we refit our ships. It has promise.",
    "80F5C504": "We predicted an object of great worth in the wilderness. Likewise, we predicted that you would find it. And here you are.",
    "80F5C505": "This must be what happens when ancient tech meets terraforming processes. New Monarchy thanks you for the specimen.",
    "80F5C506": "An intriguing find. Ordinarily I am not interested in the flotsam of our past, but this—this points to a future.",
    "80F5C507": "What you've found lies at the intersection of multiple timelines. It should let us explore uncalculable probabilities. Well done.",
    "80F5C509": "A fragment of the Golden Age, transformed by the Traveler's energies? This has great potential. We will investigate.",
    "80F5C50A": "See how the Traveler crushes and breaks everything it touches. This is valuable evidence that we are not safe here.",
    "80F5C50B": "Ah yes, this will do nicely. It seems the Traveler's awakening has brought mysteries to the surface.",
    "80F5C50C": "What an intriguing mystery. We shall treat your find with reverence, Guardian.",
    "80F5C50E": "This enigma troubles me. If it is valuable, it will draw enemies and sow dissent. We will study it closely.",
    "80F5C50F": "A fragment of our past, touched by the Traveler in the present I see beautiful futures spiraling out of this.",
    "80F5C5BB": "It's a crashed ship that bears some Fallen insignia. Let me check the logs, see if I can figure out where it came from. ",
    "80F5C5BE": "It belonged to Prince Uldren! What is it doing on Mars? Do you think he knows about Rasputin?",
    "80F5C674": " And we're in business!",
    "80F5C677": "The main access is encrypted. Good thing I know a few tricks. At least that seems to run in the family.",
    "80F5C678": "You two clear a path while I try to find a way into Clovis Bray.",
    "80F5C679": "Ana Bray? Hero of Twilight Gap? ",
    "80F5C67A": "I'm picking up a lot of Hive activity. They're swarming the core. ",
    "80F5C67B": "On it. Let me try to access the security systems. ",
    "80F5C67C": "Looks like Rasputin's core is housed in a separate structure. Hope you're up for a little exploring.",
    "80F5C67D": "How many Hive are in here?",
    "80F5C67E": "Ana? The door's unlocked. Did you?",
    "80F5C67F": "It wasn't me. Maybe he's inviting us inside. Maybe this is where questions finally turn into answers.",
    "80F5C680": "It's the Valkyrie. Rasputin's weapon. I think he heard us. ",
    "80F5C681": "Welcome to the Clovis Bray Research Facility, the fabled 'Cradle of Invention,' on Mars. ",
    "80F5C682": "You are part of an important moment in history. Together, we will strive to reach beyond the stars. Remember, you are Clovis Bray. ",
    "80F5C683": "Personnel Identified: Dr. Anastasia Bray.",
    "80F5C684": "Come on, Rasputin. Give me something here!",
    "80F5C685": "We've encountered Warminds before, but Ikora said Rasputin was trapped on Earth.",
    "80F5C686": "Rasputin is capable of operating across multiple systems simultaneously.",
    "80F5C687": "So all those times the Vanguard was trying to talk to him in the Cosmodrome",
    "80F5C689": "They were engaging fragments of Rasputin left behind after the Collapse. But his core mind was always here. ",
    "80F5C68A": "I'm here. I'm really here. I can't believe it. Clovis Bray. I'm home. ",
    "80F5C68B": "What's the status on the security systems?",
    "80F5C68C": "I'm working on it. Hang in there.",
    "80F5C68D": "This facility is massive. ",
    "80F5C68E": "The Brays dreamed big. I don't know much about my family, but I know that. ",
    "80F5C68F": "We have a big problem. ",
    "80F5C6A1": "Mars -- the first place where humanity encountered the Traveler. Home to the Clovis Bray Research Facility, and lost wonders of the Golden Age.",
    "80F5C6A4": "The icecaps have kept those wonders hidden for hundreds of years. ",
    "80F5C6A5": "But the return of the Traveler's Light has sounded an alarm heard throughout the system  and perhaps beyond.",
    "80F5C6CF": "There's no reason for this satellite to have fallen from orbit. Something pulled it down.",
    "80F5C6D2": "I think it might be time to call in help from the Vanguard.",
    "80F5C6D3": "Not a great idea. Zavala won't be happy about us digging around Bray. ",
    "80F5C6D4": "He wants the past to stay buried. But we need to get in there to find out what's going on with Rasputin.",
    "80F5C6D5": "What was that?!",
    "80F5C6D6": "Guardian, you still with me?",
    "80F5C6D8": "We're clear. Where to next?",
    "80F5C6D9": "We've found a Golden Age research facility buried inside a glacier. Where do you think? Meet me at the entrance to Clovis Bray.",
    "80F5C6DA": "I've never seen Hive like this before.",
    "80F5C6DB": "As far as I know, they don't exist anywhere but here.",
    "80F5C6DC": "We've touched down on the surface of Mars, Guardian. What's your status? Are you safe?",
    "80F5C6DD": "For now, but there's a whole lot of 'not safe' between us and the Clovis Bray facility, which is where we need to be.",
    "80F5C6DE": "What's so important there?",
    "80F5C6DF": "Warsats, like the one that almost hit you on approach, have been dropping out of the sky since I got here. Which usually means only one thing",
    "80F5C6E0": "Rasputin? The 'greatest weapon of the Golden Age' you were talking about? But that's impossible.",
    "80F5C6E2": "Nothing is impossible where Rasputin is concerned. Meet me at the facility.",
    "80F5C6F5": "Beginning assembly.",
    "80F5C6F8": "We have a problem that requires your attention. The Vanguard did a sweep of the existing Bray archives. We found references to the Hephaestus Index.",
    "80F5C6F9": "The index is a weapons development database. If our enemies gain access to it, they could reverse-engineer dangerous ordnance. ",
    "80F5C6FA": "I've located multiple access terminals that house the data. Destroy them.",
    "80F5C6FB": "Zavala, we've successfully destroyed the first terminal.",
    "80F5C6FC": "Excellent work. Destroy the next terminal.",
    "80F5C6FD": "Guardian, what are you doing? ",
    "80F5C6FF": "They're helping me, Zavala. The Hephaestus Index is an incredible resource. We can't lose it. I need you to trust me.",
    "80F5C700": "Do I really have any other option?",
    "80F5C701": "The hard data has been eradicated. Now we--",
    "80F5C703": "Hey, wait! ",
    "80F5C704": "I scrambled the Vanguard channel so we can have a private conversation. Look, Zavala is right about the risk, but you can't just destroy history. ",
    "80F5C705": "I understand how you feel, Ana. But what do you suggest we do?",
    "80F5C706": "Do what Zavala says. Just make me a copy. ",
    "80F5C707": "I'll be able to study the index, and Zavala won't have to worry about our enemies exploiting it.",
    "80F5C708": "All right. We'll take care of it.",
    "80F5C709": "Bringing server online.",
    "80F5C70A": "Slight complication. The Hive found you.",
    "80F5C70B": "We can handle the Hive, even the frozen kind. Just keep the network open!",
    "80F5C70C": "Great, we've got all the data. But I need extra computing power for the reassembly. Get to the main terminal.",
    "80F5C70D": "And keep the Hive away while I'm working!",
    "80F5C70E": "Let's establish a preliminary connection between the network and Ana's relay. ",
    "80F5C70F": "Connection established! Looks like the deleted data is still on two backup server shards. Access them, and I can recompile it.",
    "80F5C710": "That's one piece of the deleted data! It's not pretty, but with both halves I can reassemble it.",
    "80F5C711": "Zavala, thank you. The index is safely offline, and we can use it to recreate Golden Age tech. Think of what we can make! ",
    "80F5C712": "I am, Anastasia. And if this information ever becomes a problem, I will hold you personally responsible.",
    "80F5C713": "I wouldn't have it any other way.",
    "80F5C715": "We've intercepted the orders the couriers were carrying, Anabut they're encrypted.",
    "80F5C719": "Has to be some way to read them. Checking sensors aha! There's a Commander near your location. He should have what you need.",
    "80F5C71A": "These Psions would never take on Rasputin by themselves. But now that Ghaul's gone, I wonder who could be running what's left of the Red Legion.",
    "80F5C71B": "Maybe that's what these Psions wanted to do. Fill Ghaul's shoes. ",
    "80F5C71C": "Hey, Guardian, I'm picking up some strange radio chatter. I need you to check it out. Know anything about Psions?",
    "80F5C71E": "Telepathic, aggressive and surprisingly adaptable. They once were conquered by the Cabal, but now they fight alongside them.",
    "80F5C720": "Decrypting the files now.",
    "80F5C722": "What do they want?",
    "80F5C723": "To transform. To evolve into Flayers. But they need Rasputin to do it.",
    "80F5C724": "Yeah, they're just gonna make him mad.",
    "80F5C726": "Let's get to high ground before our guests arrive.",
    "80F5C729": "The Red Legion have stolen energy from the facility!",
    "80F5C72A": "Don't let them go offworld with those batteries. Destroy them at once.",
    "80F5C72B": "Devrim Kay had some leftover explosives that we can put to good use. He sends his regards.",
    "80F5C72C": "Why does Devrim have leftover explosives?",
    "80F5C72D": "I think we've upset whoever's in charge.",
    "80F5C72E": "There's a chart here.  It's a plan of attack on the Bray Facility.",
    "80F5C730": "Get there A.S.A.P. If you hurry, we can catch them in the act.",
    "80F5C731": "That should disrupt the Red Legion supply chain for a while.",
    "80F5C732": "Excellent work. We can't bring back those we lost, but we can make sure the Red Legion never has the opportunity to hurt us again.",
    "80F5C733": "That puts an end to that, but nothing's stopping the Red Legion from coming back.",
    "80F5C734": "If we can get Cabal communication codes, I can send a signal to the Red Legion.",
    "80F5C735": "Then you ambush them and put an end to their operation. I like where your head's at.",
    "80F5C736": "There's a gulch near you that will be the perfect ambush spot. I've made arrangements for a special surprise.",
    "80F5C737": "The Red Legion have taken enough from us. Now they're here on Mars, scavenging the ruins of our Golden Age.",
    "80F5C738": "Scouts have reported activity in your area. Intercept them and find out what they're up to.",
    "80F5C73A": "Whew, okay. My head is much clearer now. But I'm still getting faint traces of the signal. Check outside the tunnels, in case there's another amplifier.",
    "80F5C73D": "I got a fragment of the message. 'Savathun, emerge from the Deep. Take our power.' ",
    "80F5C73E": "Ana, the Hive were carrying pieces of a machine.",
    "80F5C73F": "Ugh. I hate when bugs decide to build something. It's always unpleasant.",
    "80F5C740": "There's more static coming from the tunnels. We can't have experimental Hive tech out in the wild. Shut it down. ",
    "80F5C741": "Nice work. I'll spend some time wrapping my head around all of this. It's Hive, so I'm sure it's going to be strange.",
    "80F5C742": "But at its core, their 'magic' is still just science. I'll get to the bottom of it.",
    "80F5C743": "It's a signal amplifier. They're calling something. ",
    "80F5C744": "I'm picking up a weird sort of static, and it's messing with my gear. Can you find out what's causing it?",
    "80F5C746": "I need data from our enemies. If you could help me out, I'll owe you one.",
    "80F5C749": "Bring back what was taken from us.",
    "80F5C74A": "We need supplies. Who better to take them from than our enemy?",
    "80F5C74B": "I'd like you to recover some things for me. Up for a challenge?",
    "80F5C74D": "I could use enemy materials for my research.",
    "80F5C74E": "I need more data from the enemy.",
    "80F5C74F": "The enemy has taken enough from us. It's time we take back what they've stolen.",
    "80F5C750": "Our enemies hold valuable tech that could help the war effort.",
    "80F5C752": "Hostile activity in your vicinity, Guardian. Careful.",
    "80F5C756": "There's always more to shoot.",
    "80F5C757": "Our enemies are gathering nearby. We need to deal with them.",
    "80F5C758": "Search and destroy. We need to eliminate threats before they grow too strong.",
    "80F5C759": "Could you do me a favor and clear out some enemies?",
    "80F5C75A": "I don't like the idea of hostiles being so close to Clovis Bray. We need to secure the area.",
    "80F5C75B": "Make our enemies pay for the lives they've taken.",
    "80F5C75C": "Enemies inbound. You know what to do.",
    "80F5C75E": "There's some strange topography in that sector. Let's try to map it with a scan.",
    "80F5C761": "Let's get a better understanding of Martian terrain.",
    "80F5C762": "I need a scan of that area. Could you help me out?",
    "80F5C763": "There's been some unusual readings lately. Could you have a look?",
    "80F5C764": "I've noticed some really interesting ice formations out there. Go take a scan for me.",
    "80F5C765": "I'd love to know more about where these Frozen Hive are coming from. Go take a scan.",
    "80F5C766": "I'm detecting some weird activity at a Bray terminal. Go scan it.",
    "80F5C767": "I could really use more information on the Neural Nodes. Will you scan for me?",
    "80F5C768": "This Golden Age tech is awesome. I could use more data, though. Take a scan!",
    "80F5C76A": "I'm sending you a high-profile target. Let's eliminate him swiftly.",
    "80F5C76D": "Taking out that target will put a serious dent in enemy operations.",
    "80F5C76E": "I've got a big guy for you to deal with. Hope you brought big guns.",
    "80F5C770": "We need to take out the enemy leader to scatter their forces.",
    "80F5C771": "We've located a key target on Mars. Eliminate him.",
    "80F5C772": "One of those targets seems to be giving orders to the others. Let's disrupt their operation.",
    "80F5C773": "I found an important target that you can take care of.",
    "80F5C774": "Word is there's an important enemy on Mars. I think you know what to do.",
    "80F5C775": "There's a powerful enemy nearby. Put an end to this.",
    "80F5C777": "This algorithm, it's an omni-key. My omni-key. It can unlock anything in Rasputin's database. ",
    "80F5C77A": "But that's not all. Load the data components you recovered into the core.",
    "80F5C77B": "Those data components aren't just useless code, they're blueprints. And Rasputin is recombining them in the core!",
    "80F5C77C": "Blueprints? For what?",
    "80F5C77D": "We have it, Ana. Sending you the data now.",
    "80F5C77E": "This isn't just a random sequence. It's an algorithm! I know what it's for! Get to the core and I'll explain later!",
    "80F5C77F": "I've never seen anything quite like this before. I wonder what's inside?",
    "80F5C780": "A piece of my past.",
    "80F5C781": "There's nothing here, Ana. Wait I'm detecting a unique energy signature.",
    "80F5C783": "That can't be a coincidence! Follow it and see where it leads!",
    "80F5C784": "I've been digging through Rasputin's files, and there's a similar pattern that keeps popping up.",
    "80F5C785": "After some analysis I've deciphered it. It's a set of coordinates! Head over there and check it out.",
    "80F5C786": "Ana, we found the source of the reading. My sensors tell me it's a DVALIN core. Let me see if I can pull data from it.",
    "80F5C787": "There's a reference to IKELOS a serial numberit's giving off a faint signal. Transmitting now.",
    "80F5C789": "Hmm the serial number links up with a chest that's marked as missing in the database. ",
    "80F5C78A": "Search the facility. It's got to be there somewhere. ",
    "80F5C78B": "Ana, we've retrieved your well, we don't know what it is. The data is encrypted.",
    "80F5C78D": "The encryption is a sequence, a really familiar one.",
    "80F5C78E": "But this is only one piece of the data. There's got to be another. We can use this piece to track the missing one.",
    "80F5C78F": "Ana, we've found the chest, but it's empty. Must have been the Red Legion.",
    "80F5C790": "Is there any inch of this facility that they haven't picked clean?",
    "80F5C791": "Don't worry, we'll find them. ",
    "80F5C7C1": "Whoa! Was that another quake?",
    "80F5C7C4": "No, just an exploding Cabal injection rig.",
    "80F5C7C5": "Well done.",
    "80F5C7C6": "Well, they won't be using that rig again.",
    "80F5C7C7": "Nice! The explosion also jump-started a mainframe I was fussing with, so great work all around.",
    "80F5C7C8": "The Cabal sure are persistent, I'll give them that.",
    "80F5C7C9": "Don't worry. We'll deal with them as many times as it takes.",
    "80F5C7CA": "All right, let's clear out these scavengers.",
    "80F5C7CB": "Got it. We can't let Bray tech fall into Cabal hands.",
    "80F5C7CC": "The Cabal have had enough. They're running with their tails between their legs!",
    "80F5C7CD": "The Cabal have tails?",
    "80F5C7CE": "No. At least, I don't think so. They do wear a lot of armor.",
    "80F5C7CF": "We stopped them in their tracks. They won't get any more intel here.",
    "80F5C7D0": "You would think they'd find a more inconspicuous way to gather data.",
    "80F5C7D1": "Watch out, there's another injection rig headed your way.",
    "80F5C7D2": "I'm detecting a Cabal ship entering Martian airspace.",
    "80F5C7D3": "It's dropping an injection rig. All Guardians in the vicinity, be advised.",
    "80F5C7D4": "Another day, another injection rig down.",
    "80F5C7D5": "Nice! I'll head over and study what's left of it. Maybe we can reverse engineer some of their technology.",
    "80F5C7D6": "Yeah, about that",
    "80F5C7D8": "You broke everything, didn't you?",
    "80F5C7D9": "Are those the guys that took out the Tower?",
    "80F5C7DA": "Yeah, but we gave them some payback. You didn't get to meet Ghaul. Not a pleasant guy.",
    "80F5C7DB": "Let's make sure they don't make that mistake again.",
    "80F5C7DC": "That thing's not going anywhere without a ventilation system.",
    "80F5C7DD": "All of the vents are destroyed. Now it's time to finish the job.",
    "80F5C7DE": "The Cabal are on the run. That would have been a lot worse if you hadn't been there.",
    "80F5C7DF": "The Cabal are getting away. But, don't worry about it, we'll stop them next time.",
    "80F5C7E0": "The rig is neutralized! We stopped them in their tracks.",
    "80F5C7E1": "You make it look easy.",
    "80F5C7E2": "Nicely done. The Cabal didn't stand a chance.",
    "80F5C7E3": "We're getting pretty good at this.",
    "80F5C7E5": "Don't be shy. Something on your mind?",
    "80F5C7E9": "We could have used a Guardian like you at Twilight Gap.",
    "80F5C7EB": "I don't bite. Let me know if you need something.",
    "80F5C7EC": "I look busy, but I can multitask. Need something?",
    "80F5C7ED": "We should mobilize quickly.",
    "80F5C7EE": "Let's get the ball rolling.",
    "80F5C7EF": "Give me one sec. ",
    "80F5C7F0": "It's strange being here. Some parts are so familiar, and some feel so alien.",
    "80F5C7F1": "You should have seen Freehold in the old days. My grandfather put Mars on the map when Dust Palace was built.",
    "80F5C7F3": "My sister Elsie seemed to love this place. I wish we could see more of the machines she built—they sound incredible.",
    "80F5C7F4": "I still think about the Battle of Twilight Gap. I don't remember much. There was smoke and ash. I heard Shaxx shouting, but I just kept firing my gun. Over and over. ",
    "80F5C7F5": "Did you ever meet Andal? He taught me a lot about being a Hunter. He kept telling people that Cayde was Rasputin, though.",
    "80F5C7F6": "I used to run with a fireteam. We called ourselves the Night Wolves. No relation to the Iron Lords. Then there was only one. Zavala would call me a lone wolf, and I can't say he's wrong.",
    "80F5C7F7": "The Tower wasn't my favorite place, but I have a lot of friends and memories there. It was a part of me, and I was a part of it. Things change so quickly these days. I can't even keep up anymore.",
    "80F5C7F8": "I'm not sure which Clovis Bray my father hated more: the company or his father. He didn't want anything to do with Bray Corp. It wasn't perfect, but we did some important work here. ",
    "80F5C7F9": "I know what you're thinking. 'She's from Clovis Bray. She must have answers about my past and the Deep Stone Crypt.' Well, I don't. Despite all my digging, I'm still in the dark on a lot of things.",
    "80F5C7FA": "Zavala and I, we don't always see eye to eye. But he's a good leader, and better with people than I am. I admit I could learn some things from him.",
    "80F5C7FB": "Rasputin seems to think there's something more out there. I can't shake the feeling that we're headed toward catastrophe.",
    "80F5C7FC": "I can't believe Xol's been under the Martian surface this whole time. How long was he sleeping there? Centuries? Millennia? Things aren't always what they seem.",
    "80F5C7FD": "We've got work to do.",
    "80F5C7FE": "Talk to me when you're ready.",
    "80F5C800": "No rest for the weary, huh?",
    "80F5C801": "How are you holding up?",
    "80F5C802": "Step into my office.",
    "80F5C803": "How are you liking the Valkyrie? I wish we had weapons like that at Twilight Gap.",
    "80F5C804": "I could really go for some ramen right about now.",
    "80F5C805": "I never imagined Rasputin would turn out the way he did.",
    "80F5C806": "It's a lot quieter out here than the City. I don't miss all the drama.",
    "80F5C807": "I'm ready when you are.",
    "80F5C809": "A fellow Hunter. Nice. We don't always get the appreciation we deserve, do we?",
    "80F5C80B": "What's your Golden Gun accuracy? I don't mean to brag, but mine's pretty good.",
    "80F5C80D": "You remind me of another Hunter I once knew.",
    "80F5C80F": "You seem a little wound up, Titan. Can I help you with something?",
    "80F5C811": "Titans and Hunters get along like cats and dogs. But we all need to work together if we want to make a difference.",
    "80F5C812": "I can tell you're itching to get on the front lines. I get it. It's part of your Titan nature.",
    "80F5C814": "How's Ikora doing? She was one tough Warlock. You remind me of her in a lot of ways.",
    "80F5C815": "You're not one of those Followers of Osiris, are you? Because those guys are interesting.",
    "80F5C817": "Why do you Warlocks like to float around everywhere? You can jump sometimes, you know.",
    "80F5C818": "Xol's gone, but Mars is still overrun with Hive. We have a lot of cleanup to do.",
    "80F5C819": "Rasputin's exceeded what I thought possible. It's alarming, but I know he's on our side.",
    "80F5C81A": "It's a good thing we put an end to Nokris's ritual.",
    "80F5C81B": "I don't know if I will ever be as brave as you, Camrin. ",
    "80F5C81C": "I wonder if she dreams where she is now. I hope so. She deserves that much.",
    "80F5C81D": "I haven't given up finding an answer, Camrin. I hope you know that. ",
    "80F5C81E": "Whenever I'm not sure what to do, I think of you, Camrin. The best version of me is the one you saw. ",
    "80F5C81F": "Let's check the logs. 'Cosmodrome Vanguard Incursion' Were they trying to contact Rasputin?",
    "80F5C820": "What do you want, Rasputin? I see your sense of humor hasn't changed.",
    "80F5C821": "Shinobu? Hmm, never heard of her. Why does she only have one name in the Damocles File?",
    "80F5C822": "There's a record here. 'Sighting Awoken ship Martian airspace contact with Fallen.' Nothing after that. ",
    "80F5C823": "This file structure is all messed up. Ever heard of defrag, Rasputin?",
    "80F5C824": "'Anomaly in the Reef' But I thought—nope, I don't have time for that right now.",
    "80F5C825": "The Hephaestus Index is huge now. Rasputin's made some new toys since last time.",
    "80F5C826": "Why do you keep rewriting your moral structures, Rasputin? This is why people have problems trusting you.",
    "80F5C827": "Rasputin activated protocol Siberian Entropy for a long-term plan. Did I happen to find him on my own, or is this something he already predicted?",
    "80F5C828": "I don't have access to some of Willa's files. What were you up to?",
    "80F5C829": "Back so soon? How can I be of assistance?",
    "80F5C82B": "You have any updates?",
    "80F5C82C": "Take as much time as you need.",
    "80F5C82D": "If I missed something, let me know.",
    "80F5C82E": "Rasputin predicted you'd return. Just kidding.",
    "80F5C82F": "Are you adjusting to Mars yet?",
    "80F5C831": "Our work is never over.",
    "80F5C832": "Welcome back.",
    "80F5C834": "Keep up the good work.",
    "80F5C835": "You've been a big help.",
    "80F5C837": "Still in one piece?",
    "80F5C839": "Let's make it happen.",
    "80F5C83A": "There's a long road ahead of us.",
    "80F5C83B": "Anything I can help with?",
    "80F5C83C": "Feels good to be back.",
    "80F5C83E": "Rasputin needs us.",
    "80F5C83F": "Let's work together.",
    "80F5C841": "This place has definitely seen better days.",
    "80F5C842": "I admit Rasputin can be a little temperamental. Nothing to worry about, though. He just wants to help us.",
    "80F5C843": "Rasputin ed a substantial amount of Guardian traffic at some place on Earth called 'The Weep.' The strange part is, not a lot of bullets were fired.",
    "80F5C844": "I really believe Rasputin can do some good. We just need to trust him, and then he'll trust us.",
    "80F5C845": "I hate how the Cabal think they can raid this place. They don't get to walk in here and take things from my family.",
    "80F5C846": "I came across this data module, but I can't decrypt it. There might be something out there that can help us. ",
    "80F5C847": "This data is a relic from a bygone age. Maybe you can unlock its secrets. ",
    "80F5C848": "I found this while digging through the archives. I wonder what it means.",
    "80F5C849": "Someone or something wanted us to find that data. Thanks for your help, Guardian.",
    "80F5C84B": "Nice work out there. Whoever wanted that data was trying to tell us something. ",
    "80F5C84C": "Good job. A lot of questions still need answers, but we got what we needed. ",
    "80F5C84D": "All yours.",
    "80F5C84E": "Be careful with that.",
    "80F5C84F": "Good hunting.",
    "80F5C850": "I hope it's useful.",
    "80F5C851": "Have fun with that.",
    "80F5C852": "See you later.",
    "80F5C853": "Stay sharp.",
    "80F5C854": "Don't be a stranger.",
    "80F5C855": "Let me know if you find any Golden Age tech out there.",
    "80F5C856": "I'm here when you need me.",
    "80F5C8BC": "Tougher than the last wave, right? Apparently that's the idea. ",
    "80F5C8BF": "Now that they're immune to his 'Siberian Entropy' protocol, Rasputin's trying to straight-up exterminate the Hive.",
    "80F5C8C0": "Wouldn't a Golden Age AI have a more efficient way to thin their numbers?",
    "80F5C8C1": "I asked him the same thing. He hasn't gotten back to me.",
    "80F5C8C2": "Here comes trouble. Big, ogre trouble.",
    "80F5C8C3": "Get out of line of sight while you can and STAY out of it. Unless you like a steady diet of Void energy.",
    "80F5C8C4": "We do not.",
    "80F5C8C5": "Ogres inbound. They're not just overgrown Thrall. I double-checked.",
    "80F5C8C6": "The only thing worse than an Ogre is another Ogre. Don't let your guard down.",
    "80F5C8C7": "We've got Ogres. Don't let up once they're almost gone. That's when they're the most dangerous.",
    "80F5C8C9": "Don't get too close to these Ogres. I don't like it when you get squashed.",
    "80F5C8CB": "Ogres on their way. Don't let them see us. Or let them see us and then get out of the way.",
    "80F5C8CC": "Hive Ogres. If we don't get to cover, their Void blasts will melt your shield like well, it won't be pretty.",
    "80F5C8CE": "Big teeth, big claws, big weird. head. These Ogres are just as ugly as usual. Maybe more.",
    "80F5C8D0": "Here come more Ogres. Aim for the gross part. The biggest gross part.",
    "80F5C8D2": "Weird Warmind pillar, swarm of angry Hive looks like fun. Let's mix it up.",
    "80F5C8D4": "He says he's done playing defense and he's ready to turn it around.",
    "80F5C8D5": "I like the sound of that. Let's grab a Valkyrie.",
    "80F5C8D6": "Sounds like things are getting as dark for you there as they are out here. ",
    "80F5C8D7": "He says he's no longer able to 'inhibit their summoning'. Better steel yourself.",
    "80F5C8D8": "Watch the sky. There are Wizards headed our way.",
    "80F5C8D9": "I could go another few hundred years without seeing those monsters again. Good luck.",
    "80F5C8DA": "We've got Wizards incoming. The Hive must really be mad.",
    "80F5C8DB": "Watch out for Hive spells. Their Wizards have their sights on us.",
    "80F5C8DC": "Looks like we've got problems on the ground AND in the air. Wizards.",
    "80F5C8DD": "Wizards headed toward us. Focus on their shields and we'll make it through this.",
    "80F5C8DE": "More Wizards on the way. Stay out of range unless you want to become one of their experiments.",
    "80F5C8DF": "Fighting Wizards would be a lot easier if we knew what Hive magic actually was. But in the meantime",
    "80F5C8E1": "Here come more Wizards. Watch out for their poison clouds. Those haven't gotten any easier to survive.",
    "80F5C8E2": "Wizards inbound. One good blast and their shield will shatter.",
    "80F5C8E3": "Here come the Acolytes. But nothing we can't handle. We've got this.",
    "80F5C8E4": "I would say that's my line, but you two can borrow it for a while.",
    "80F5C8E5": "The Hive never seem to run out of Acolytes. More on the way.",
    "80F5C8E6": "We've drawn out the Acolytes. They'll try to find cover. Let's not let them.",
    "80F5C8E7": "Acolytes, headed this way. Too scared to charge at us. Want to show them they're right?",
    "80F5C8E8": "A wave of Acolytes is incoming. Watch out for their grenades. Or make them watch out for yours.",
    "80F5C8E9": "Shredder Acolytes, inbound. Don't take them lightly. Just because I rez you a lot doesn't mean I like it.",
    "80F5C8EA": "There's something strange in the threat signature on this one. A huge difference between potential and maximum power.",
    "80F5C8EB": "I've brought down enemies like that before. It'll draw energy from whatever's nearby unless you take out its power source first.",
    "80F5C8EC": "No problem.",
    "80F5C8ED": "Another one of those power siphons Ana told us about. Let's take it out before it can grow even stronger.",
    "80F5C8F0": "Don't let the size of this one fool you. It's going to draw more power somehow.",
    "80F5C8F2": "This is it. Unless we stop this thing fast, it's going to keep getting more powerful. Eyes up.",
    "80F5C8F4": "We have to be careful here. Our target has some kind of power-boosting capability. But we can do this.",
    "80F5C8F6": "We'd better find some cover. Those Acolytes are going to hit us with sniper fire.",
    "80F5C8F7": "Or TRY to. I say hit 'em with a taste of their own medicine. They won't see THAT coming.",
    "80F5C8F8": "Acolytes incoming. SNIPER Acolytes. Let's not get caught in the open.",
    "80F5C8F9": "Sniper Acolytes inbound. Time to get to cover. Or flush them out from theirs.",
    "80F5C8FA": "Snipers are about to make things complicated. Keep your eyes peeled for Acolytes.",
    "80F5C8FB": "Acolytes are on the way. They're going to snipe us from long range. Let's do it to them first.",
    "80F5C8FC": "Good thing you're such a good long-range shot. Because these Acolytes are about to start shooting US from a distance.",
    "80F5C8FE": "We don't need a translation this time. The air FEELS different.",
    "80F5C8FF": "Don't worry. You've got this.",
    "80F5C900": "Cover your ears. The Hive are sending Shriekers this time.",

    "80F5C902": "There's a Shrieker nearby. Aim for the core and we'll do fine.",
    "80F5C903": "Shriekers incoming. Let's take them out fast, and then get away in a hurry.",
    "80F5C904": "Shriekers. Once they start firing, they won't stop until one of us is dead. Let's make sure it's them.",
    "80F5C906": "Here come the Shriekers. They can't be tougher than Savathun's Song, right? Let's hope not.",
    "80F5C907": "These Shriekers fire too fast. Don't try to trade shots.",
    "80F5C908": "It figures they'd send Shriekers to try and stop us. We're kind of famous with the Hive.",
    "80F5C909": "Ikora says she doesn't know what Shriekers are made of. Let's blow them up and see what comes out.",
    "80F5C90A": "Uh-oh. I see them. Cursed Thralls.",
    "80F5C90B": "Ugh. My least favorite Hive — and they have a lot of competition. Don't get too close.",
    "80F5C90C": "More exploding Hive. Maybe Rasputin can zap them from orbit? Eh, let's take care of them ourselves.",
    "80F5C90D": "Here comes a wave of Cursed Thrall. Don't bother aiming for the eyes — they don't have any.",
    "80F5C90E": "Watch out. Cursed Thrall incoming. We'd better keep our distance.",
    "80F5C90F": "Cursed Thrall. Remember when we ran into them on Titan? Sometimes I still see them when I close my eye.",
    "80F5C910": "The Cursed Thrall are back. I know they may seem like they deserve our pity, but don't fall for it.",
    "80F5C911": "More Cursed Thrall. At least we're out in the open.",
    "80F5C912": "Cursed Thrall. Watch for their arms. If they go wide, we should be somewhere else.",
    "80F5C913": "Cursed Thrall. If we can spread them out, a chain reaction might take them all down.",

    "80F5C91A": "Cleaver Knights. They'll try to get close. Let's not let them.",
    "80F5C91B": "That might be the toughest Knight I've seen since Crota. Keep your distance until we know what he's capable of.",
    "80F5C91C": "Or she. Female Knights are even MORE fierce. But not as fierce as you, right? You've got this.",
    "80F5C91D": "This Knight is going to be tough. But we've survived tougher. Let's get him.",
    "80F5C91E": "Whatever this Knight was up to before this, he's focused on stopping us now. We should stay focused, too.",
    "80F5C91F": "Another Knight that'll try to kill us in new ways. And this one might be more successful than most.",
    "80F5C920": "This Knight is crackling with Hive energy. We shouldn't take him lightly.",
    "80F5C921": "If we survive this, I won't make fun of the way Hive Knights look again. I swear.",
    "80F5C922": "He says he's incremented a version number and upgraded something. Nothing in there sounded like a 'thank you', though.",
    "80F5C923": "We're used to it. We've got our own rewards here, anyway.",
    "80F5C924": "But what IS Rasputin up to?",
    "80F5C925": "Somehow I knew you'd end up in Rasputin's experiment. He calls it the 'Escalation protocol'. ",
    "80F5C926": "Draw out as many Hive as you can, and leave nothing standing.",
    "80F5C927": "Rasputin says 'congratulations on initiating the 'escalation protocol'.'",

    "80F5C92D": "Boomer Knights on the way. If we get close, we've got the advantage.",
    "80F5C92E": "Keep an eye out for shields. We've got Knights with Arc launchers in the area.",
    "80F5C92F": "Hope you're limbered up. Knights are headed this way, and they've got Boomers.",
    "80F5C931": "There are Knights incoming. I don't know what those Boomers shoot, but how about we DON'T find out firsthand.",
    "80F5C932": "Hang on — there's something different with this one. It's almost encouraging us to attack head-on. Save your ammo.",
    "80F5C933": "Hard to argue with the indirect approach; it's kept me alive a lot longer than I ever expected. Keep an eye out for a weak spot.",
    "80F5C934": "Let's not be too hasty here. I don't think emptying your clips into this target is going to be effective.",
    "80F5C935": "Here comes the big one. But something tells me it's going to be more complicated than shoot-and-run.",
    "80F5C936": "This one's got a weak spot — I'm sure of it. Keep your eyes open.",
    "80F5C938": "As much as I know you like unloading your entire ammo reserves into the bad guys, you might want to hold off this time.",
    "80F5C939": "Don't fire just yet. This one's tough, and I don't think a direct assault is going to work.",
    "80F5C93A": "Thrall this time. This shouldn't be too tough.",
    "80F5C93B": "That's usually what someone says before they get swarmed by a bunch of Thrall. Don't be that someone.",

    "80F5C941": "We've got Thrall incoming. Even with no eyes, they've already spotted us.",
    "80F5C942": "There's about to be a swarm of Thrall on top of us. Hope your armor can handle it.",
    "80F5C943": "Here come the Thrall. Barely even skin and bones, but they're still a big enough target.",
    "80F5C944": "And it's only going to get harder, he says.",
    "80F5C945": "I can feel that Wizard's power from here. She'll be a tough one to take down.",
    "80F5C946": "And you don't have spells to counter hers.",
    "80F5C947": "No, but we've got the firepower.",
    "80F5C948": "That Wizard's shield isn't going to be easy to bring down. Good thing you're such a good shot.",
    "80F5C94A": "This is going to be some powerful magic. But nothing we haven't seen before. Eyes up, Guardian.",
    "80F5C94C": "Another impossible fight against an overwhelmingly powerful Wizard. We're going to win this one, too.",
    "80F5C94D": "See that horrifying, hideous Wizard? We should take its robe as a souvenir. After we destroy its owner.",
    "80F5C94E": "I don't know if Rasputin counted on a Wizard this powerful showing up. But we're ready. Let's go.",
    "80F5C94F": "This is it. Wait — I'm getting feedback when I run a defense analysis on our target. Whatever it is, it's got SIGNIFICANT protection.",
    "80F5C951": "Pull it away from its buddies if you can. And once you get its armor down, don't let up.",
    "80F5C952": "I've seen some nasty behavior from bad guys with busted shields.",
    "80F5C953": "This thing is way better armored than we are. Focus on taking down its defense first.",
    "80F5C954": "A tough challenge with a tough defense. I'm ready if you are, but let's be smart about how we do it.",
    "80F5C955": "End of the line. And someone with a whole lot of armor is waiting for us.",
    "80F5C956": "The shielding on what we're about to fight is no joke. But I know you always take things VERY seriously.",
    "80F5C957": "Heads up: there is a LOT of armor on whoever's leading this charge. Get ready.",
    "80F5C959": "Heads up. Energy signatures on those Knights are showing Splinters.",
    "80F5C95A": "At least their Solar bolts are hard to miss. Just make sure they miss YOU.",
    "80F5C95B": "Hive Knights are bad enough. These Knights have got Splinters. That's worse.",
    "80F5C95C": "Spread-shot Knights, headed for our position. And those flaming bolts will be, too.",
    "80F5C95D": "Splinter Knights incoming. Get out of the way or get in their face, as Cayde would say.",

    "80F5C95F": "I'm reading Knights on the way. We'd better get ready to move — they're packing Splinters.",
    "80F5C960": "Look at the size of that Ogre. This is NOT going to be easy.",
    "80F5C961": "If it was easy, then we wouldn't be Guardians. I believe in you.",
    "80F5C962": "I still remember the Void burns from the last time we fought an Ogre this size. We'd better find cover now.",
    "80F5C964": "Giant Ogre. Let's not get anywhere near him. Those claws will tear through anything you're wearing.",
    "80F5C965": "I wish this Ogre was chained up like Phogoth, back in the Summoning Pits. How about we make him wish he was.",
    "80F5C966": "The teeth on that Ogre are probably worth a lot of Glimmer to the right buyer. Too bad they'll be gone by the time we're done with him.",

    "80F5CA7D": "The latest and most exciting application of this new state of matter is within the field of engramic computation.",
    "80F5CA7E": "Physically encoding conventional silicon transistors allows them to safely store exponentially more information in a smaller space.",

    "80F5CBF1": "Zavala, listen to me. I've studied the logs. Rasputin was barely able to stop Xol the first time.",
    "80F5CBF2": "Our mission stands. We will defeat Xol, and we don't need the help of a Warmind to do it. Not when we don't know what else it might do.",

    "80F5CC10": "It looks like the Hive have been busy down here.",

    "80F5CC18": "Apparently he went behind his father's back to commune with Xol, one of the Hive worm gods.",
    "80F5CC19": "Nokris that name sounds familiar.",
    "80F5CC1B": "He's one of Oryx's sons.",
    "80F5CC1C": "Nokris was weak in strength, but had a brilliant mind. He abandoned Oryx, and sought forbidden power.",

    "80F5CC1E": "He's Oryx's other son, but was excommunicated.",
    "80F5CC1F": "The interference is getting worse, but I'm starting to pick up a pattern. Do you hear it, Ana?",
    "80F5CC20": "I'll need more data to be sure, but yeah, I'm thinking it might be an encoded message.",
    "80F5CC21": "Guardian? Guardian?! Where are you?!",
    "80F5CC23": "The feeding ground is right below us.",
    "80F5CC24": "I've decoded the interference pattern. Akka, Eir, Yul, Ur those are names, Guardian. Ancient, powerful names. This is more than we-- ",

    "80F5CC2D": "We're ready for this, Guardian. We can stop Nokris!",
    "80F5CC2F": "Looks like that's our target! Nokris! Careful, Guardian, he's pulsing with soulfire!",
    "80F5CC31": "Look at the size of these tunnels. Xol must be immense. ",
    "80F5CC32": "Meaning Xol is stronger than we thought.",

    "80F5C0B3": "I hear your Vanguard wasn't much help in your quest to avenge a friend. That's not surprising. ",
    "80F5C0B4": "I've heard what you did for Cayde-6, Guardian. Sounds like you two were very close Sorry for your loss.",

    "80F5C0C4": "Do you always stand there saying nothing?",
    "80F5C0C6": "You guardians just come in here and stand around it can get a little claustrophobic.",

    "80F5CED5": "He's an ancient worm god, one of the original few that made the Hive into what they are today.",
    "80F5CED6": "He was brought here by a fanatical priest named Nokris. Rasputin froze Nokris and Xol, but now they're loose. We have to put down Xol for good.",
    "80F5CED7": "I can't believe it. You did it! You took down a worm god!",
    "80F5CED9": "We all did. We're a team now, Ana. A good one.",
    "80F5CEDA": "I knew you could do it, Guardian. You saved Rasputin and Mars.",
    "80F5CEDC": "We couldn't have done it without you, Ana. Thanks for the assist.",
    "80F5CEDD": "Thank Rasputin. This was his plan.",
    "80F5CEDE": "Xol's down!",
    "80F5CEDF": "You did it! Rasputin is saved!",
    "80F5CEE0": "You know we've always got your back, Ana.",
    "80F5CEE1": "And I've got yours.",
    "80F5CEE2": "Way to go, Guardian!",
    "80F5CEE4": "We couldn't have done it without you, Ana.",
    "80F5CEE5": "We make a pretty good team, if I do say so myself.",
    "80F5CEE6": "The inhibitor vent is open! ",
    "80F5CEE7": "I've never seen anything so powerful! Be careful. ",
    "80F5CEE9": "Keep fighting!",
    "80F5CEEA": "Try to hold on a little longer. Ana is bringing the Neural Net online!",
    "80F5CEEB": "Complete core meltdown initiated. If you can hear this message, you are too close to the core. ",
    "80F5CEEC": "Oh no. With the inhibitor offline, the Neural Network is going crazy. ",
    "80F5CEED": "I'll try to stabilize it. Defend the area!",
    "80F5CEEE": "The Valkyrie is surging with energy far beyond what my sensors are capable of analyzing.",
    "80F5CEEF": "The Valkyrie has been successfully charged, but it looks like we may have shut down the facility in the process.",
    "80F5CEF0": "Bad news, you also shut down Rasputin's defenses! I'm plotting you a direct path to Xol. You gotta move!",
    "80F5CEF1": "The energy readings from the Valkyrie are off the charts!",
    "80F5CEF2": "Let's see what Xol thinks of cutting-edge Bray tech.",
    "80F5CEF3": "The Valkyrie is supercharged!",
    "80F5CEF4": "Nice work! Now comes the hard part taking down Xol.",
    "80F5CEF5": "If we overload Rasputin's core, we can use the excess energy to overcharge the Valkyrie. I think that's our only chance of really hurting Xol.",
    "80F5CEF6": "We're going to use the Valkyrie. You're getting pretty good with it.",
    "80F5CEF8": "But it still needs more power. We're going to overload Rasputin's core, then soak up the excess energy with the javelin.",
    "80F5CEF9": "Xol's exoskeleton is pretty tough. You're going to need the Valkyrie, a special javelin that's part of Rasputin's Neural Network.",
    "80F5CEFA": "Using Rasputin's core, we'll be able to overcharge the Valkyrie and do some serious damage.",
    "80F5CEFB": "How?",
    "80F5CEFC": "Well, first we've got to overload the core.",
    "80F5CEFD": "Defeating Xol with conventional weapons is too dangerous. We need Rasputin's help. ",
    "80F5CEFE": "Luckily, he's given us access to the Valkyrie, a powerful javelin that's part of his Neural Network.",
    "80F5CEFF": "But even the Valkyrie will need some additional power to stop Xol. We'll use Rasputin's core to overcharge it.",
    "80F5CF00": "Got it! Neural Net is online and ready. Now for the inhibitor vent",
    "80F5CF01": "Core power levels approaching critical overload. Personnel are recommended to evacuate.",
    "80F5CF02": "All right. I need you to throw the Valkyrie into the core and force a full meltdown.",
    "80F5CF03": "That node is giving off strange readings. I need a closer look.",
    "80F5CF04": "Open the cooling vents on the inhibitors. Then hit it with everything you've got.",
    "80F5CF05": "Attention, Neural Net Inhibitor offline. Core power levels rising. Continued fluctuations will result in a critical failure. ",
    "80F5CF06": "All personnel are advised to initiate safety protocols. Remember: a safe work environment is a happy work environment.",
    "80F5CF07": "Xol is tearing apart Rasputin's Neural Network, and if he does enough damage, he could trigger a chain reaction that will devastate Mars. ",
    "80F5CF08": "All I know is we have one advantage left the Valkyrie.",
    "80F5CF09": "I'll never trust Rasputin, but we'll need every weapon we have to stop Xol even one that's powered by a Warmind.",
    "80F5CF0A": "Guardian, we have an emergency! Rasputin is under attack!",
    "80F5CF0C": "How is that possible? What's big enough to threaten Rasputin?",
    "80F5CF0D": "It's Xol! He's launched a direct assault!",
    "80F5CF0E": "What can we do?",
    "80F5CF0F": "Get to the power station and I'll help you take him down!",
    "80F5CF10": "Calling all Guardians! We're under attack!",
    "80F5CF11": "Don't worry, Ana. We're here.",
    "80F5CF12": "I hope you're ready for a fight, because this one is serious. The Hive worm god Xol has surfaced from beneath Mars, and he's attacking Rasputin!",
    "80F5CF13": "Head to the power station and I'll fill you in. Together we can stop him. ",
    "80F5CF14": "Ana, there's a giant Hive creature attacking Rasputin!",
    "80F5CF15": "It's a Hive worm god. He's called Xol, and he's going to tear apart Rasputin unless we act fast!",
    "80F5CF16": "What can we do?",
    "80F5CF17": "Head to the power station. I've got a plan to take him down, but I need your help!",
    "80F5CF18": "Stabilized! Kind of. But the Valkyrie is ready! ",
    "80F5CF19": "I'll keep rerouting power to your location.",
    "80F5CF1B": "Valkyrie is ready to deploy.",
    "80F5CF1C": "Javelin is online and ready.",
    "80F5CF1D": "Auxiliary power has been activated! Get to a node and power up the javelin!",
    "80F5D065": "Here they come again.",
    "80F5D068": "I got hostiles inbound at our 10 and 2.",
    "80F5D069": "We got company!",
    "80F5D06A": "Heads up! ",
    "80F5D06B": "We're gonna need an ammo re-up soon.",
    "80F5D06C": "Relay: We need an evac out on the Spine.",
    "80F5D06D": "You're clear for landing, Guardian. Transmat at will.",
    "80F5D06F": "New orders from Petra. Transmitting on a local snap.",
    "80F5D070": "Sounds like things are kicking off at the monastery.",

    "80F5D074": "Standby for standby.",
    "80F5D075": "Go ahead, field team. ",
    "80F5D076": "I don't think it was Riven that caused this curse.",
    "80F5D077": "Keep your chin up. We can beat this curse.",
    "80F5D078": "Keep charging the Blind Well, Guardian. That's the key.",
    "80F5D07A": "This curse has killed so many of my friends.",
    "80F5D07B": "We have a chance to break the curse. We can't waste it.",
    "80F5D07C": "It breaks my heart to see the Dreaming City like this.",
    "80F5D07D": "Heard.",
    "80F5D07E": "Got it.",
    "80F5D07F": "Yup.",

    "80F5D321": "I thought Variks took off.",
    "80F5D323": "That's the Warden's Servitor that went insane soon as Variks left the building. Must have some codependency issues. It's running the whole facility on a subroutine it calls 'Challenge of the Elders.'",
    "80F5D325": "Prison of Elders welcomes you. Impress your Warden, yes?",
    "80F5D327": "Is that Variks?",
    "80F5D329": "Haha, hell no. Variks left his pet Servitor behind, and the thing went nuts, thinks it IS him. It's running the whole prison through some kinda combat drills.",
    "80F5D32B": "Prison of Elders welcomes you. Impress your Warden, yes?",
    "80F5D32D": "Don't mind the PA—that's the Warden's Servitor. Thing shorted its brain when the Warden left the prison. It thinks it IS the Warden, uses a print of his voice.",

    "80F5D331": "This is one o' the Vex cellblocks. The Awoken dragged all kinds of subtypes outta their 'hoods. The ones that survived are some tough sons.",
    "80F5D333": "This here is a Vex cellblock. I didn't think time-traveling robots would form gangs in prison, but there are Vex here of multiple subtypes, slaved to a single Mind.",
    "80F5D335": "Next up is a cellblock for the Vex. You ever see a Vex eat? Heard the creamy center's organic. I been watching them from out here, but haven't seen it happen.",

    "810017D7": "You signed the waiver. Now explode each other. [laughs]",
    "810017D8": "Arcite, bring me that haggis while I call this match? No, those are bullets. Never mind. I'll do it myself.",
    "810017D9": "If you lose here, I'll tell you what you did wrong: You didn't throw enough grenades. You should be throwing grenades as I say this.",
    "810017DA": "Mayhem simulates open war. Show me what you can do with no limits!",
    "810017DB": "Mayhem is a coming together of friends. Now do as friends do—incinerate each other with your Light.",

    "810017E4": "A tie? In MAYHEM? What is wrong with you people? Throw more grenades!",
    "810017E5": "So you lost. Don't let it upset you. This is Mayhem. Perhaps try throwing more grenades?",
    "810017E6": "I'm sorry. There is no Redrix's Claymore for losing matches. But perhaps there should be. Arcite, grab a pen and paper. I have an idea.",
    "810017E7": "Two fireteams of Guardians, head-to-head, with no limits on their Light. Someone was bound to lose. Make sure it's them next time.",
    "810017E8": "Your Light means you're never truly dead. Embrace that and fight again.",
    "810017E9": "So they beat you this time. But how many grenades did you throw? Huh? Did you count them? Really. Ask yourselves: 'Did I throw all the grenades I could?'",
    "810017EA": "Mayhem.",

    "810018A6": "Be proud of what you've done today.",
    "810018A8": "No reward is as well earned as one from a well-fought victory.",
    "810018A9": "You made it look almost effortless. But I know better.",
    "810018AA": "Excellent. A victory like that is why the Iron Banner exists.",
    "810018AB": "Do you feel stronger? Haha. You should.",
    "810018AD": "You worked well together. Hang on to that.",
    "810018AE": "More victories like this will carry the Iron Banner into a new age.",
    "810018AF": "That was a battle worthy of Iron Lords.",
    "810018B0": "Lord Shaxx couldn't have done it better.",
    "810018B1": "You are like a hero from the Dark Age. Keep fighting and you will have Zavala's job someday.",
    "810018B3": "There are days when even the Vanguard get sloppy. Not like you. You have iron focus.",
    "810018B4": "You have Ikora's instinct. Kindred spirits, the two of you.",
    "810018B5": "When I see you, I see hope for tomorrow, Guardian.",
    "810018B7": "The end has come, and here you stand. A battle worthy of the Iron Lords.",
    "810018B8": "The original Iron Lords may be gone. But I can see the future is safe in your hands.",
    "810018B9": "Only the best could defeat you. Perhaps one day, you and I can dance.",
    "810018BA": "Such a victory stirs the blood. Maybe I'll get back in there tonight.",
    "810018BB": "When the Iron Lords enjoyed such a victory, the high lasted for days.",
    "810018BC": "One of the most impressive victories I've seen.",
    "810018BD": "I wish the Iron Lords could have met you. They would have hated you. You'd push them to be better.",
    "810018BE": "Sound tactics and improvisation that I've not seen since Ikora. Excellent.",
    "810018BF": "You're telling me they haven't made you Tower Commander yet? You can tell Zavala I said that.",
    "810018C1": "Do you like it better when Lord Shaxx oversees these matches? So do I. A busy Shaxx is a quiet Shaxx.",
    "810018C2": "A tie.",
    "810018C3": "I'm calling it.",
    "810018C4": "Your lead has grown, but don't let up. They won't.",
    "810018C5": "A bigger lead. But now your enemy is complacency.",
    "810018C6": "They've fallen further behind your lead. Well done.",
    "810018C7": "You've extended your lead. I'm not surprised.",
    "810018C8": "Now your lead is even greater. But it's not over.",
    "810018C9": "Your lead grows sharper!",
    "810018CA": "I hate ties.",
    "810018CB": "There were no ties in the Dark Age. Just death A LOT of death.",
    "810018CC": "Well. Do it again.",
    "810018CD": "You've almost won. But don't let up. They won't.",
    "810018CE": "Victory is yours for the taking. Seize it!",
    "810018CF": "Keep the pressure on. It's almost over.",
    "810018D0": "A glorious dawn is coming, Guardian. Finish this.",
    "810018D2": "Don't let up 'til it's over.",
    "810018D3": "Heh. Shaxx would be yelling.",
    "810018D4": "Don't let up until they're dust, Guardian. This isn't over.",
    "810018D6": "Your vigilance paid off. Now destroy them.",
    "810018D7": "A surge of power—and now you lead.",
    "810018D8": "Your persistence serves you well. Fight on.",
    "810018D9": "That's a start. You can turn this around.",
    "810018DA": "There's always a way forward. Keep fighting.",
    "810018DB": "A stirring victory!",
    "810018DC": "You are victorious!",
    "810018DD": "That's it. You've won!",
    "810018DE": "Enough! Your victory is secured.",
    "810018DF": "Well fought, and well won.",

    "810018E2": "Undeniable.",
    "810018E3": "Well-fought.",
    "810018E4": "Good.",
    "810018E5": "I've faced worse defeats, but we're both still standing.",
    "810018E7": "Stand proud—even in defeat.",
    "810018E9": "The measure of a Guardian is how they handle defeat.",
    "810018EB": "Rest for now. Think. What have you learned from this?",
    "810018ED": "If you face them again, remember this day.",
    "810018EE": "The Iron Banner remembers every outcome. This will be no exception.",
    "810018EF": "Look to this defeat for motivation in the times to come.",
    "810018F0": "The Iron Lords never stopped. Nor will you.",
    "810018F1": "Even in defeat, you show yourselves worthy.",
    "810018F3": "With this loss, you will grow into something stronger.",
    "810018F5": "Even the most brittle steel can be tempered. You'll be back.",
    "810018F6": "Even after this defeat, your will is unbroken. I know it.",
    "810018F7": "There is nobility in defeat. Come back stronger.",
    "810018F8": "You're a Guardian. What's defeat to you? Dust off and fight again.",
    "810018FA": "Defeat only stops you if you let it. The Iron Banner is always open to you.",
    "810018FB": "A Guardian fights for as long as they intend to. Find me again when you're ready.",
    "810018FD": "When the Iron Lords faced defeat there was only one option. Fight again.",
    "810018FE": "The Collapse couldn't stop humanity. Defeat shouldn't stop you. When you're ready, I'll be here.",
    "81001900": "The world faced myriad hardship in the Dark Age. Defeat was a constant. You can overcome it, too.",
    "81001901": "The match is over, but not the journey. When you're ready, the Iron Banner is waiting.",
    "81001903": "Defeat is not the end. Be defiant, Guardian. Fight again.",
    "81001905": "Be vigilant. Make your next opponents pay for this defeat.",
    "81001907": "I believe in you, Guardian! Take this fight to them!",
    "81001909": "I'll never give up on you. You can still win this.",
    "8100190A": "Keep up the pressure. You'll catch up before you know it.",
    "8100190B": "You're building momentum. Don't give up.",
    "8100190C": "You're pulling ahead.",
    "8100190D": "The lead is yours.",
    "8100190E": "One minute. Victory is within your grasp. Fight!",

    "81001910": "Opponent took the lead.",
    "81001911": "Your opponent pulled ahead.",
    "81001912": "Their lead has grown. But they're still within reach.",
    "81001913": "Their small lead has become something more. Don't let them continue.",
    "81001914": "And like that, their lead grows.",
    "81001915": "Be wary. Your opponents' lead has grown.",
    "81001916": "A greater lead for your opponents. You must do something to catch them.",
    "81001917": "This isn't over until Shaxx sings. And he's very shy.",
    "81001918": "It was inevitable. You've taken the lead!",
    "81001919": "Now it's a battle. Crush them.",
    "8100191A": "They hammered you, and still you fight on. Now win this.",
    "8100191B": "Sometimes the greatest revenge is to simply persist. Finish them.",
    "8100191C": "Thirty seconds. Take it from them!",
    "8100191D": "They've won. But you'll be back.",
    "8100191E": "You've lost today, Guardian.",
    "81001920": "Hard fought, but no victory today.",
    "81001921": "They got the better of you.",
    "81001922": "Learn from this defeat.",
    "81001923": "Not this time.",
    "81001924": "Can't win them all.",
    "81001925": "Losses happen.",
    "81001926": "Hmm. Could've gone better.",
    "81001927": "You will endure.",
    "81001928": "Guardian: crush them.",

    "81001945": "Your weapon defines you.",
    "81001946": "Show them what you can do.",
    "81001948": "You look pleased.",
    "8100194A": "Overtime. Fight.",

    "8100194D": "You're closing the gap. Hammer them.",
    "8100194E": "You could teach Lord Shaxx a thing or two about focus. Powerful comeback.",
    "81001950": "You're more relentless than Commander Zavala. He should be watching you.",
    "81001952": "They were convinced they had you. But you fight to the bitter end. Good.",
    "81001953": "Your enemy gained a second wind. Knock it out of them.",
    "81001954": "Your enemy has forgotten who's stronger. Remind them.",
    "81001955": "It's a shame to see that one end. But there is no shame in such a victory.",
    "81001956": "I bet you've worked up quite a sweat during this win. Enjoy that feeling.",
    "81001958": "You danced with death and won. That was poetry in motion.",
    "8100195A": "The Iron Lords could have used you. You embrace battle like an old friend.",
    "8100195C": "It's almost over. Don't let them have it easy!",
    "8100195D": "They've almost taken this one. Make them earn it.",
    "8100195E": "If they prevail, it won't be because you let them. Keep fighting!",
    "8100195F": "Your opponents have nearly won. Show them you won't go quietly.",
    "81001960": "Five minutes. The pendulum could swing either way.",

    "8100197A": "You have nothing to be ashamed of. This was a noble loss.",
    "8100197B": "Every Guardian loses. The key is what you do next. Fight again.",
    "8100197C": "You lost, but what is loss to an immortal? When you're ready to fight again, I'll be here.",
    "8100197E": "There is always a place for you at the Iron Banner if you wish to fight again.",

    "80F5D769": "Two down!",
    "80F5D76A": "I haven't met a warrior like you since the Dark Age. Guardians are saints! So polite. I think the City makes them that way. It's easy to be an angel in heaven. But you understand. You're no saint.",
    "80F5D76C": "There will come a day when hope dies. When the sky darkens and a shadow swallows the sun. When this city falls again—and it will—it may not rise. Every generation faces a reckoning. When yours comes, we'll need you and what you can do.",
    "80F5D76E": "DIE, DIE, DIE—sorry. I've, uh, I've been watching too many Iron Banner matches. What time is it? Shaxx? Shaxx, are you there? Can you get me a water? Stop yelling; it's just a question. I'M NOT OLD.",

    "810019AC": "So many Hunters lost but you honor them.",
    "810019AD": "Despite what some might say, agility is NOT overrated.",
    "810019AE": "So many lethal strikes. They must fear you now.",
    "810019AF": "Hunters. The Iron Lords had those. We called them 'people with guns.'",
    "810019B1": "You are lethal.",
    "810019B3": "Your power reminds me of Jolder's. You would have liked her.",
    "810019B4": "No mercy for opponents weaker than you. Which is all of them, it appears.",
    "810019B6": "They were thinking of you when they named us 'Titans.'",
    "810019B8": "Titans. The Iron Lords had those. We called them 'big people.'",

    "80F5DB05": "Guardian! Attend me.",
    "80F5DB07": "Eh, next time, dispatch them more slowly. I barely had a chance to enjoy the display. Daw.",
    "80F5DB08": "Good, Light-borne. Your powers of observation are adequate.",
    "80F5DB0A": "Perhaps with a bit more expediency next time, eh, little Guardian? No matter. Congratulations on your protracted victory.",
    "80F5DB0C": "Do not tarry here too long, my young ones. There is pleasure to be had elsewhere.",
    "80F5DB0D": "Tread lightly, little Guardian. While I never tire of watching you die, there are more pressing matters for you to attend to.",

    "80F5DB15": "There are many gardens of delight on my Leviathan. The Red Legion know not of such pleasures, and cannot abide their existence.",
    "80F5DB16": "Tell me, does your Traveler offer you such splendor? Appreciate such delight?",
    "80F5DB17": "Ca'uor and the Red Legion know only of war and scarcity. Death and lack. Only my loyal subjects may partake of true bounty.",

    "80FD00B6": "Come close-close-close! Talk at new friend Kaniks. Such thing I have to say at you",
    "80FD00B8": "Where am I hide? Ugly, stupid Cabal can knowing—but not you! YEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE!",
    "80FD00BA": "Red Legion ships above us. Must be the Cabal the Bomber mentioned. Let's follow them.",
    "80FD00BC": "Ooh, WHEE! Now a game truly begin!",
    "80FD00BE": "Friend Cayde? No fun to play with, no fun at all. Such a boring boy to kill-kill-KILL.",
    "80FD00C0": "Cayde MURDER Eliksni. Think you DIFFERENT, think you HERO? Joke at you.",
    "80FD00C2": "This place is rigged to blow. We have to leave. Hurry.",
    "80FD00C4": "No matter what the Bomber said, you're not a murderer. Guardians are defenders of the Light.",

    "80FD00D5": "How did the Mindbender get a throne-world this big?",
    "80FD00D6": "Oh. Cayde.",
    "80FD00D7": "This guy's file says he's obsessed with creating his own throne world, like Crota and Oryx had.",
    "80FD00D9": "The Mindbender thinks he can create it by killing powerful beings.",
    "80FD00DA": "This guy's file says he's obsessed with creating his own throne world: a pocket dimension in the Hive's Ascendant Plane.",
    "80FD00DB": "When the Hive kill powerful beings, their throne worlds increase in size.",
    "80FD00DC": "But that should only work for the Hive.",
    "80FD00DD": "That's the last amplifier. The signal we're tracking now is from the source. The Mindbender.",
    "80FD00DE": "I need a minute to triangulate the signal's origin.",
    "80FD00DF": "I've traced the original signal to a nearby cave. Let's check it out.",
    "80FD00E0": "Stay on him!",
    "80FD00E1": "This one has a safeguard. I'll need a minute to disable it.",
    "80FD00E2": "Another amplifier.",
    "80FD00E3": "Got the coordinates. The signal's coming from that crashed tombship.",
    "80FD00E4": "We've got to go; this place is destabilizing.",
    "80FD00E5": "I want to think Cayde can rest easier now that the throne-world built from his death has been destroyed.",
    "80FD00EA": "We're on her. Let's go.",
    "80FD00EE": "All set. Let's ride.",
    "80FD00F0": "Take the Rider's Pike for a spin. We won't have to find her; she'll find US.",
    "80FD00F2": "Hmm, it's biometrically calibrated. Let me run some diagnostics. I can tune it.",
    "80FD00F4": "These Pikes have some unusual mods.",
    "80FD00F6": "Petra's files say Cayde caught the Rider the first time by beating her in a race.",
    "80FD00F8": "There's Prison of Elders security footage of her swearing revenge on him.",
    "80FD00FA": "And well. You know the rest.",
    "80FD00FC": "Almost there. Bear with me.",
    "80FD00FE": "Get me to a computer. I can unblock that passage to the north.",
    "80FD0100": "There she is.",

    "80FD0106": "These Pikes have a very distinctive exhaust signature, and right now it's all over my scanner. The Rider's gang is nearby.",
    "80FD0108": "They're talking to the Rider on a secured frequency. We can triangulate her location with a little more data.",
    "80FD010A": "This garage belongs to one of Uldren's Barons: Yaviks, the Rider.",
    "80FD0110": "Ah Target practice.",
    "80FD0113": "He's retreating, but I'm tracking his position.",
    "80FD0114": "You know, there's a reason I keep a low profile when you fight. It's just smarter. But Cayde's Ghost was just like him.",
    "80FD0115": "Flashy, cocky and incredibly competent. She didn't deserve to go down like that.",
    "80FD0116": "Lightweight simulation tech. I've never seen anything like it. If we find more, let's grab it.",
    "80FD0117": "This is a sniper's nest. Great sightlines",
    "80FD0118": "We're on the Baron that murdered Cayde's Ghost. That was a one-shot kill. Keep your guard up.",
    "80FD0119": "I… seeeee you",
    "80FD011A": "…Or I mount your Ghost on my wall next to Cayde's [laughs]",
    "80FD011B": "King Uldren wants you dead. [laughs]",

    "80FD0131": "Good news: The engram fabricators are destroyed, and I traced the source of the Trickster's broadcast.",

    "80FD0446": "The attack against the Dreadnaught was a calculated sacrifice. Everyone knew going in that they were likely to die.",
    "80FD0448": "All Awoken dream, but mine seem to be more vivid than others'. Perhaps it's because I lived with the Techeuns after Amethyst was destroyed.",
    "80FD0449": "Did you know Sedia says she used to know Zavala before he died and became a Guardian? She says he hasn't changed much.",
    "80FD044B": "I can't excuse Uldren's crimes, but sometimes, I do miss him. I can't help it.",
    "80FD044D": "I met Cayde after the Skolas incident. He'd sneak out of your Tower, try his hand at the Prison of Elders. Talked about you a lot. Even after the Queen after the Taken War, he kept checking in.",
    "80FD044E": "Cayde came to me about the Scorned Barons. Wanted me to join a team he called 'Cayde's Six.' I know. I'm still not sure if he was joking about that name or not.",
    "80FD044F": "In the Reef War, Uldren and I fought side-by-side. I called him a friend. When his ship went down in the battle of Saturn I mourned him. The man who came back to the Reef as if back from the dead I don't recognize him.",
    "80FD0450": "If Uldren thinks our past will stay my hand he's mistaken. I'm going to put him down like the treacherous animal he is.",
    "80FD0452": "Being Regent-Commander of the Reef was hard enough without the Scorned Barons always circling, like vultures waiting for their prey to die. After Cayde helped me put them away, things were easier for a little while.",
    "80FD0454": "Being Regent-Commander was a nightmare. I never wanted to lead. I've only ever wanted to serve. But with the Queen, the Techeuns, and most of the Paladins gone I had no choice.",

    "80FD0484": "Copy that. I'll send out a requisition list.",

    "80FD0488": "The Taken War never truly ended",
    "80FD048A": "Hold on—did you say Zavala? I'll make the time. Put him through.",
    "80FD048C": "Amrita says she's stabilized, but I want Kalli to check on her as soon as possible.",
    "80FD048E": "If it's just some will-o'-the-wisp, I don't care. I have no time for fairy tales.",
    "80FD0490": "Ask the Techeuns to take a look. They'll know what to do.",
    "80FD0491": "Tell Paladin Oran the Reef envoy to Reksis entered at Tharsis.",
    "80FD0493": "Yes. We've got Guardians in the Blind Well around the clock. The Well is critical.",
    "80FD0495": "Shuro, Kalli, come in. I've lost contact with Sedia.",
    "80FD0497": "No. I've moved the forward base to the Shore. Send them to me.",
    "80FD0499": "Go ahead, Zenith.",
    "80FD049B": "This place used to be a haven. Now look at it",
    "80FD049D": "No response at all? Then pull them out. If we can't travel safely through the Ascendant Plane, leave it to the Guardians.",
    "80FD049F": "Keep hunting. I want the head of every Hive you can find.",
    "80FD04A1": "Yes, all of it. Collate everything we have and send it on to Rasputin.",
    "80FD04A3": "Sedia is standing vigil in the Confluence. She'll send word if anything happens.",
    "80FD04A5": "Don't lose heart. We're in this together.",
    "80FD04A7": "I wish I could go with you into the field. Command posts ruin me.",
    "80FD04A9": "After your Traveler woke, my dreams became darker. Brighter lights deeper shadows.",
    "80FD04AA": "I almost became a Techeun, you know. Maybe everything would have been different if I'd chosen that path.",
    "80FD04AC": "Cayde used to ask where the Awoken really lived. Whether we had 'good loot.'",
    "80FD04AE": "Don't lose heart, Guardian. We'll find him.",
    "80FD04B0": "Uldren is still out there. No time to stand around.",
    "80FD04B1": "When every name on that list is crossed out then I can rest. Not before.",
    "80FD04B3": "Here to resupply? Me too. Then it's back to the field.",
    "80FD04B5": "Do you ever dream of your Traveler? I used to. Until it woke.",
    "80FD04B6": "Still fighting the good fight, I see.",

    "80FD04E4": "Keep an eye on your Ghost. Especially in here.",
    "80FD04E6": "I'm keeping an eye on the Watchtower. If he goes there, I'll know.",
    "80FD04E8": "I should never have involved you and Cayde. This was my problem. My failure.",
    "80FD04EA": "Reef-made. It'll serve you well.",
    "80FD04EC": "You'll like that one.",
    "80FD04EE": "Good choice.",

    "80FD0527": "Tell me what you've found. It's only fair to give me the right of first refusal.",
    "80FD0529": "I hear the Queen had a treasure room in the prison. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?",
    "80FD052B": "Business waits for no one. Not even you.",
    "80FD052D": "Don't keep me waiting.",
    "80FD052F": "I wonder whom you've killed today.",
    "80FD0531": "Is this a friendly visit, or are you here to talk business?",
    "80FD0533": "Such a shame about Cayde-6. He was always good for a laugh, was he not? And a speedy bullet. Ah. I weep for all the profitable alliances that will never be.",
    "80FD0535": "Look after your Ghost. It would be quite a shame if he joined my collection.",
    "80FD0537": "The Prison of Elders is quite astonishing to me. Did the Queen think she was being merciful, throwing her enemies in there?",
    "80FD0539": "No one has called me 'Wolf' in a very long time. I was born into that House, yes. But even then I knew a bad investment when I saw one.",
    "80FD053B": "I knew immediately I had no intention of staying in the company of 'Wolves.' I was tempted towards a more permanent vacation on the Tangled Shore.",
    "80FD053D": "Many of my misguided Fallen brethren still attempt to fight. I prefer a more mutually beneficial relationship—easier to stay alive that way.",
    "80FD053F": "The Reefborn aren't as clean as they like to play. Look at the Prison of Elders.",
    "80FD0541": "Ahhh, I miss Variks. Did you know the Awoken really believed that ridiculous accent of his? Yeah, he had them wrapped around his claws.",
    "80FD0543": "The Shore is lucky to have me keeping a watchful eye over it once again.",
    "80FD0545": "Happy as I am about the 'disappearance' of the Scorned Barons, their mess is still yet to be fully cleaned up.",
    "80FD0547": "My boys are doing their best to rid my beautiful Shore of those annoying Scorn.",
    "80FD0549": "It's a shame you'll never be 'properly introduced' to some of my most prized possessions. I can't risk it, you understand.",
    "80FD054B": "As 'fun' as the dead prince's presence was, it's better that he gets a very, very long, quiet rest.",
    "80FD054D": "Ah, my Guardian friend!",
    "80FD054F": "Good, good. Friends should visit each other.",
    "80FD0551": "I'm always open to a new deal.",
    "80FD0553": "Excellent, excellent. Welcome, my friend.",
    "80FD0555": "I do enjoy hearing of your achievements.",

    "80FD0559": "You've done right by me, friend. I won't forget that.",
    "80FD055B": "The savior of Spider's Shore!",
    "80FD055D": "Nice of you to drop by in between bouts of killing Scorn.",
    "80FD055F": "No Barons means better quality of life for me and my boys, and it's all thanks to you.",
    "80FD0561": "Greetings, my slippery friend.",

    "80FD0569": "Greetings, my elegant friend.",
    "80FD056B": "Greetings, my clever friend.",
    "80FD056D": "How regrettable. Ah well. Business is business.",
    "80FD056F": "Bring me Avrok. I have a task for him.",
    "80FD0571": "Bring me Arrha. I have a task for him.",
    "80FD0573": "Who else remains on the Shore? I want names.",
    "80FD0575": "My dear Lady Alderdice, if the Seven Stars won't have you, why should I?",
    "80FD0577": "Is this from the Crystal Barrows?",
    "80FD0579": "A poor investment. A poor investment indeed!",
    "80FD057B": "I think the Awoken will find my prices are the best prices.",
    "80FD057D": "Tell him I'm listening, but not for long.",
    "80FD057F": "Another VEIST shipment gone missing? Oh! Tell our friends we can offer them protection for a price.",
    "80FD0581": "My, my, how did a SUROS shipment land on my doorstep? Ah, well. It's not polite to ask questions.",
    "80FD0583": "Tell them the jewels are straight from the Crystal Barrows. It's the truth as far as they know.",
    "80FD0585": "Always room in my home for another Guardian friend.",
    "80FD0587": "Don't be shy. It bores me.",
    "80FD0589": "If you want something, speak up.",
    "80FD058B": "How do you like my Shore?",
    "80FD058D": "No matter how far you go, you always come back to the Spider.",
    "80FD058F": "I'm not a patient Spider.",
    "80FD0591": "Do you have need of my associates again?",
    "80FD0593": "Haha! Guardians never cease to amuse.",
    "80FD0595": "You never cease to amuse, my friend.",
    "80FD0597": "Let's make a deal.",
    "80FD0599": "I think you'll find our friendship agreeable.",
    "80FD059B": "Here for a favor?",
    "80FD059D": "Shall we make a deal?",
    "80FD059F": "I'm eager to continue our friendship.",
    "80FD05A1": "What does my Guardian need?",
    "80FD05A3": "What catches your eye?",
    "80FD05A5": "Come now, I don't bite. I have people who do that for me.",
    "80FD05A7": "The Drifter, here? And he didn't say hello? How disappointing.",
    "80FD05A9": "Business improves daily. I am quite pleased.",
    "80FD05AB": "So many questions! I'm becoming offended. You don't want to see me offended.",
    "80FD05AD": "It sounds delightful! I want it. Make it happen.",
    "80FD05AF": "Better to have killed them than sent them to the Prison of Elders.",
    "80FD05B1": "I'm sure we can find something mutually agreeable.",
    "80FD05B3": "How awful! Tell me more.",
    "80FD05B5": "Surely a Guardian must always keep his word?",
    "80FD05B7": "Marvelous.",
    "80FD05B9": "You have good taste.",
    "80FD05BB": "Marvelous.",
    "80FD05BD": "Very good.",
    "80FD05BF": "I approve.",
    "80FD05C1": "Good choice, my friend.",
    "80FD05C3": "First impressions are very important.",
    "80FD05C5": "It suits you, my friend.",
    "80FD05C7": "How soon until that is stained with blood? [snicker]",
    "80FD05C9": "I had to kill a man to acquire that. I'm kidding. I didn't have to kill him.",
    "80FD05CB": "Treasure that, my friend.",
    "80FD05CD": "Don't worry. I had it thoroughly cleaned.",
    "80FD05CF": "That's a rare piece indeed. Treasure it.",
    "80FD05D1": "Until we meet again.",
    "80FD05D3": "You may go.",

    "80FD05F5": "Two Barons down. Six to go. Then Uldren.",
    "80FD05F8": "Four Barons down.",
    "80FD05F9": "Six names off our list. Only two left—then Uldren.",
    "80FD05FA": "Maybe Petra or Spider has a lead on the Machinist and the Fanatic for us.",
    "80FD0A45": "These statues depict Techeuns: powerful Reefborn advisors and generals. The last of them died with the Queen in the Taken War.",
    "80FD0A49": "Approaching the watchtower on foot.",

    "80FD0A53": "This tree is very old. Is it from before the Collapse?",
    "80FD0A55": "Just after. It was planted to commemorate the arrival of the Awoken.",
    "80FD0A57": "Nooooooo!",
    "80FD0A59": "FREE ME, O brother mine ",
    "80FD0A5B": "No. No, no, no, no ",
    "80FD0A5D": "Something's wrong.",
    "80FD0A5F": "This doesn't look like it belongs here. Did Uldren track this in?",
    "80FD0A61": "Open the door, Brother.",
    "80FD0A63": "OPEN THE DOOR.",
    "80FD0A65": "I can't",

    "80FD0A75": "The end.",

    "80FD0A79": "Guardian: The 'why' of what we're doing is as important as the 'what.'",
    "80FD0A7B": "I don't know what you're thinking but remember that.",
    "80FD0A7D": "Guardian. No one has stood where you are since the Queen closed these doors.",
    "80FD0A7F": "Welcome home cousin.",
    "80FD0A81": "Yours are the first outsider eyes to ever see this place.",
    "80FD0A84": "The Scorn are forever",

    "80FD0AA4": "FREE ME.",
    "80FD0BA8": "Well, now, this is very curious.",
    "80FD0BAC": "Ahh, cheers.",
    "80FD0BAE": "Thanks, Guardian.",
    "80FD0BB0": "You're my favorite. Shh. Don't tell anyone.",
    "80FD0BB2": "Next time, we set up the secret base on a dry planet.",
    "80FD0BB4": "All runs together, doesn't it? Maybe just me.",
    "80FD0BB6": "The City stood as a beacon, unbowed, for so long. It fell to the Red Legion as I stood watch. Never again, Guardian.",
    "80FD0BB8": "A passion for hard work. I like that.",
    "80FD0BBA": "My friend and ally.",
    "80FD0BBC": "I'm supposed to be grateful. So ...ahem.",
    "80FD0BBE": "Thank you so much!",
    "80FD0BC0": "What am I supposed to do with this?",

    "80F5D70E": "Do you have a moment to help an old lady with something?",
    "80F5D710": "I'm afraid I'm at my wit's end you don't mind, do you?",
    "80F5D712": "You Guardians are so kind to me. I hate to ask for anything more",
    "80F5D714": "I think perhaps you will like this one",
    "80F5D716": "[clears throat]",
    "80F5D718": "Any questions?",
    "80F5D71A": "Can I help?",
    "80F5D71C": "Guardian?",
    "80F5D71E": "Take your time",
    "80F5D720": "I've been, um, seeing a gentleman. His name is Kweku. He's a Vanguard technician. Carlos would have liked him.",
    "80F5D722": "My husband and daughter are still with me. I speak with them every day. You might think I sound crazy, but I know they can hear me.",
    "80F5D724": "You're looking a bit peckish. If Carlos were here, he would cook you his famous pomefig compote. My late husband was an excellent cook.",
    "80F5D726": "Kweku and I went to the theater the other week. 'The Iron Wolves,' it was called. Some of the effects gave me quite a fright! I must have looked like a wreck, because that evening Kweku insisted on walking me all the way back to my front door.",
    "80F5D728": "Sometimes I feel quite useless, surrounded by all of you Guardians. But then I think, 'I may not be able to fight, but I can still try and bring a smile to your faces!'",
    "80F5D72A": "Kweku is a widower as well. Sometimes we talk for hours about my Carlos and his Sylvie. Not a very normal kind of date, is it? But it works for us.",
    "80F5D72C": "This holiday was much different when I was a girl. But I guess it was a different world then",
    "80F5D72E": "I did miss Dawnings in the Tower. You feel that much closer to the sky.",
    "80F5D730": "Being away from the last Dawning made me realize how special of a holiday it is. So truly: Happy Dawning to us all.",
    "80F5D732": "I'm a little light for this Dawning. So to speak. But next year I'll have had time to make gifts for all of you.",
    "80F5D734": "In the olden days, they would celebrate Crimson Days by exchanging cards with sappy messages on them. Rahool described it as a 'mating ritual.'",
    "80F5D736": "I do love watching you Guardians ask out your Crimson Doubles. You're all just so cute!",
    "80F5D738": "I read that Guardians used to celebrate Crimson Days by severing the... Well. I'm glad that traditions have evolved since then.",
    "80F5D73A": "I've seen more than a few Guardians stealing kisses when they think no one is watching. It warms old Eva's heart.",
    "80F5D73C": "There are many things I missed during my time away from the City. Would you be surprised to learn that chocolate is near the top of the list?",
    "80F5D73E": "Don't let your quest consume you, dear. If you dwell too long on those who were taken from us, it'll turn to poison.",
    "80F5D740": "Justice for Cayde's death may not bring you peace. Not everything wraps up so neatly, I'm afraid.",
    "80F5D742": "My doctor told me to take it easy on the candy. I told him I told him to shove it! It's the Festival of the Lost, for heaven's sake!",
    "80F5D744": "I'm surprised there's been no ceremony to honor the Speaker's passing. Has everyone forgotten him so soon?",
    "80F5D746": "This is the one time of year I'll indulge my sweet tooth. Well, the Dawning, too. And Crimson Days. And whenever that new ice cream shop opens up in the City.",
    "80F5D748": "The City certainly has recovered since the war. I thought it would be different, after everyone we've lost, but we come back.",
    "80F5D74A": "There are still ghosts in this new Tower. Not the ones that float around and bring you Guardians back from the dead. Real ghosts. They're mostly harmless.",
    "80F5D74F": "Guardian! Please, come in, come in.",
    "80F5D751": "Hello, hello. Please, come in.",
    "80F5D753": "Hello, dear! What a nice surprise!",
    "80F5D755": "You're famous, Guardian. If I could help you, it would be just",
    "80F5D757": "You're looking wonderful! Did your muscles get bigger?",
    "80F5D759": "How nice to see you! Did you get taller? Or am I getting shorter",
    "80F5D75B": "Come here and let me look at you!",
    "80F5D75D": "Oh, I'm so happy to see you.",
    "80F5D75F": "I was just hoping you'd stop by today!",
    "80F5D770": "Blessings of the season to you, Guardian.",
    "80F5D772": "The Darkness approaches. We must raise our Light.",
    "80F5D774": "The Darkness wanes, Guardian. You are the Light.",
    "80F5D776": "A wonderful Dawning to you!",
    "80F5D778": "The Dawn will come.",
    "80F5D77A": "May this be your happiest Dawning yet, Guardian.",
    "80F5D77C": "You'll always remember the joy brought to those receiving your gifts.",
    "80F5D77E": "May the flames of your oven burn bright, Guardian.",
    "80F5D780": "You can never bake enough for those you love.",
    "80F5D782": "A new dawn approaches. Let us welcome it the right way.",
    "80F5D784": "Hold your loved ones close, Guardian. Never let them go.",
    "80F5D78C": "The winds are warm and hearts are light.",
    "80F5D78E": "Happy Crimson Days to you!",
    "80F5D790": "Love one another, Guardian.",
    "80F5D792": "The happiest days are those spent with the ones we love.",
    "80F5D794": "A small show of affection can go a long way.",
    "80F5D796": "No matter near or far, it's never a bad time to show others you care.",
    "80F5D8A5": "Do you feel it, Guardian? Love is in the air.",
    "80F5D8C3": "Love each other.",
    "80F5D8C9": "Always remind those close to your heart how much you care, Guardian.",
    "80F5D8CB": "Don't let the Revelry pass you by, Guardian.",
    "80F5D8CE": "Enjoy the Revelry, my friend!",
    "80F5D8D1": "I do enjoy seeing my Guardian friends having so much fun. ",
    "80F5D8D3": "Spring is my favorite time of year. Simply stunning.",
    "80F5D8FC": "Release your inhibitions! It's time to celebrate.",
    "80F5D952": "Let loose, my friend. That's what the Revelry is for.",
    "80F5D960": "Oh, everyone likes to break a rule now and then. It's time to celebrate!",
    "80F5D962": "Spring is a beautiful reminder of our world's resiliance.",
    "80F5D964": "You enjoy the pandemonium now. I had my fill during the Red War.  ",
    "80F5D967": "Something tells me this is also your favorite time of year.",
    "80F5D969": "May your Solstice of Heroes be brilliant, Guardian.",
    "80F5D96C": "You're on display today, my friend. Make us proud.",
    "80F5D96F": "Celebrate all of your victories! It's the meaning of Solstice.",
    "80F5D971": "Solstice is about you and your accomplishments, Guardian.",
    "80F5D974": "Without you, there would be nothing to celebrate.",
    "80F5D976": "You do so much for us. It's only right we give back.",
    "80F5D97A": "My friend, today is your day.",
    "80F5D97D": "Be triumphant. We expect nothing less.",
    "80F5D980": "You are a hero to us all.",
    "80F5D985": "Happy Solstice, Guardian.",
    "80F5D989": "Cayde would want you to be happy, my dear. He wouldn't want to see you this way.",
    "80F5D98D": "When I lost Caros and Maria there was no one person I could blame for it. I thought that would make it easier, but looking at you, I'm not so sure.",
    "80F5D994": "May death pass you by for one more night, Guardian.",
    "80F5D997": "Enjoying the festival?",
    "80F5D99C": "Laugh in the face of death, Guardian.",

    "80F5D9AC": "Have you lit your candles yet? For those you've lost?",
    "80F5D9B3": "Too often, we mourn the dead. Today is a day to celebrate them.",
    "80F5D9B7": "We must never forget those we have lost.",
    "80F5D9BA": "I hope you have found many masks.",
    "80F5D9CC": "Life is precious, Guardian. That is why we must celebrate it.",
    "80F5D9CF": "We lost many in the Red War. They must not be forgotten.",
    "80F5D9D5": "Don't forget—for many, this is a time of healing.",
    "80F5D9D9": "We have ALL lost someone. Let's celebrate their lives, not their deaths. ",
    "80F5D9DE": "Death is a deeply important part of us all, Guardian.",

    "80F5DA1B": "Still more to do. I could use some coffee.",
    "80F5DA1D": "Give a little joy, get a little joy.",
    "80F5DA1F": "Don't forget. Don't forget. Wait, what was it?",
    "80F5DA21": "I'm glad you're still with me, Carlos. You too, Maria.",

    "80FD0D85": "Wonderful. I know it'll work for you.",
    "80FD0D87": "Ahh, outstanding. Use it well.",
    "80FD0D89": "Goodbye, dear.",
    "80FD0D8B": "Good luck, Guardian.",
    "80FD0D8D": "Come back soon!",
    "80FD0D8F": "I do enjoy our visits.",
    "80FD0D91": "Do come back soon, Guardian.",
    "80FD0D93": "Tell your friends about Eva!",
    "80FD0D95": "Stay safe.",
    "80FD0D97": "OK, back to work!",
    "80FD0D99": "They never really leave us, you know. That's what the festival is about.",
    "80FD0D9B": "Be happy! It's what our loved ones want.",
    "80FD0D9D": "Remember those we've lost, my dear.",
    "80FD0D9F": "Youngsters, always in a hurry. I was young once too.",
    "80FD0DA1": "Enjoy these days, Guardian. Make them last.",
    "80FD0DA3": "Love's light shines on you, Guardian.",
    "80FD0DA5": "There are many kinds of love, Guardian. Don't be afraid to get your heart broken.",
    "80FD0DA7": "May the Light preserve and protect you.",
    "80FD0DA9": "Spread that Dawning cheer, Guardian.",
    "80FD0DAB": "Blessings of the Traveler upon you, Guardian.",
    "80FD0DAD": "Light protect us all.",
    "80FD0DAF": "Stay warm, dear.",
    "80FD0DB1": "Do try to keep that cape clean, dear.",
    "80FD0DB3": "We feel so much safer with you Hunters watching the skies.",
    "80FD0DB5": "We feel so much safer with you Titans out there.",
    "80FD0DB7": "Do try to keep those beautiful pauldrons clean, dear.",
    "80FD0DB9": "Do try to keep those robes clean, dear.",
    "80FD0DBB": "We feel so much safer with you Warlocks doing um whatever you do.",
    "80FF4302": "There. I scrambled your location. Zavala won't know you're breakin' the quarantine on Old Russia. Do me a solid and stick to the Wall, OK?",
    "80FF4307": "All hell's gonna break loose if the big guy finds out you're there.",
    "80FF4308": "Meantime, I'll keep you covered. See if you can find any clues nearby. Then track down the Fallen bastards that did this.",
    "80FF4309": "After all, you've got some practice.",
    "80FF430A": "OK, got your signal. Where'd you end up? Oh my cotton socks—the Cosmodrome?! Uh sit tight!",
    "80FF430C": "I remember when the Hive were here, right in our backyard.",
    "80FF4315": "One good thing about the Red Legion? They kicked the snot out of those creepy crawlers.",
    "80FF4317": "We kept 'em bottled up for years, but the Cabal blew in here and torched 'em all. Thanks, Ghaul!",
    "80FF431B": "No sign o' Rasputin on Earth since he popped up out near Clovis Bray—for now, that is. Fine by me; he made me nervous even before his little upgrade on Mars.",
    "80FF431C": "I'll never forget that brand. House o' Devils were the ones that took my family.",
    "80FF431D": "They're the reason I got this sweet metal leg. I'm glad the Houses are wiped out—Devils most of all.",
    "80FF431E": "Cayde used to tell me after the war 'bout Hunters who'd sneak over the wire lookin' for spinmetal. They say it all dried up when the Traveler went dark. Weird, huh?",
    "80FF431F": "See that exodus ship over yonder? Just like the one that crashed into Nessus. Yup, ships out here in the 'Drome never made it off the ground.",
    "80FF4320": "Stuck here, just like all the folks who were hopin' to get offworld.",
    "80FF4321": "When he's not runnin' Iron Banner, Saladin sure is quiet these days. And I heard Efrideet went back to wherever she was livin'.",
    "80FF4322": "Yup, bein' an Iron Lord isn't easy, I guess.",
    "80FF4323": "One time I asked Ikora why the Golden Age leftovers are so mixed up.",
    "80FF4324": "We were colonizing other planets, right? Everyone was livin' 300 years. So why were they still drivin' around in rust buckets like this? Hmph.",
    "80FF4325": "'Member when a bunch o' nanotech-sportin' aliens came swarmin' out of Russia, and two knights with flamin' axes were the only ones that could stop 'em?",
    "80FF4328": "[sigh] It's been a weird couple years.",
    "80FF4329": "Used to be the Fallen pretty much owned the Cosmodrome. Then they just split. Right before the Legion hit us.",
    "80FF432C": "Left a lot of stuff, some of it real useful. Why put a tarp on something you're not coming back for?",
    "80FF432E": "Unless they did come back after all",
    "80FF4331": "Cayde brought me out here once. We looked at all the cars, all the people who died tryin' to get to safety during the Collapse.",
    "80FF4332": "And he said, 'Listen, don't worry about dying. Death isn't the end, not since the Traveler showed up.",
    "80FF4334": "You ever feel sad about your folks, you just wait for them to show up again as Guardians. You just wait.'",
    "80FF43C7": "…I'm still waitin'.",
    "80FF43D1": "That's where your Ghost found you, huh? Wonder if you were part of the exodus, or someone who came along after.",
    "80FF449A": "Someone who picked the wrong place to hide from the Fallen.",
    "80FF4573": "Somethin' opened up that hatch recently. Your telemetry's spikin' a lot of residual Ether around that pipe.",
    "80FF4575": "Keep your eyes out for Fallen, you hear me? I don't wanna lose you, too.",
    "80FF457D": "That's a highway to nowhere right there. I've flown all across this region, and it's just rusted-out cars, dead cities, rubble, and rebar.",
    "80FF45BD": "I can't imagine what it was like before the Collapse. Sometimes? I can't even picture a future where it's just us on Earth again.",
    "80FF45BE": "That's it, huh? You got 'em.",
    "80FF45C0": "Somethin's still buggin' me about this, though. Get back to that teleporter when you can.",
    "80FF45C2": "But listen: I don't think my little trick is gonna fool Zavala twice. This might be the last time you ever set foot in the Cosmodrome.",
    "80FF45C4": "See you back in the Tower.",
    "80FF4F65": "We have to move. Without a weapon, we're easy prey.",
    "80FF4F69": "Keep fighting! I'm scanning for nearby ships.",
    "80FF4F6B": "There's a rifle. Grab it!",
    "80FF4F6D": "I brought you back for a reason, Guardian. You're a Titan—that means you're a fighter.",
    "80FF4F6F": "So be ready. 'Cause we're deep in enemy territory.",
    "80FF4F71": "I brought you back for a reason, Guardian. You're a Hunter—that means you're not afraid to take risks.",
    "80FF4F73": "So, keep moving and be ready for a fight.",
    "80FF4F75": "I brought you back for a reason, Guardian. You're a Warlock. Your curiosity's as dangerous as any weapon.",
    "80FF4F77": "So, trust your instincts, and we'll find a way home.",
    "80FF4F79": "The Fallen are on the hunt. Let's move.",
    "80FF4F7B": "All right! I've got a signal from an old jumpship. Let's track it down.",
    "80FF4F7D": "Your Light is strong, Guardian.",
    "80FF4F7F": "Speaking of pirates",
    "80FF4F81": "There's a loot cache. Let's take what's inside.",
    "80FF4F83": "When we get to the City, you'll start to understand why I brought you back.",
    "80FF4F85": "The people, the promise of a brighter future—and the Traveler! Wait 'til you see it.",
    "80FF4F87": "They came looking for a fight. Give 'em one.",
    "80FF4F89": "More Fallen! Hit 'em with everything you've got!",
    "80FF4F8B": "This place is an old Cosmodrome—a Russian spaceport.",
    "80FF4F8D": " It's quarantined now—and quite dangerous—but our only way forward is through that wall.",
    "80FF4F8F": "Stay focused. If your tracker blinks, there's trouble nearby.",
    "80FF4F91": "A Fusion Rifle! That'll do some damage.",
    "80FF4F93": "A Grenade Launcher! That'll do some damage.",
    "80FF4F95": "A Pulse Rifle! That'll do some damage.",
    "80FF4F97": "You're doing great. Focus on the Fallen.",
    "80FF4F99": "A Sword! That'll do some damage.",
    "80FF4F9B": "A Shotgun! That'll do some damage.",
    "80FF4F9D": "A Rocket Launcher should even the odds.",
    "80FF4F9F": "We need to get through that wall.",
    "80FF4FA1": "Guardian—the ship's signal is coming from the next facility.",
    "80FF4FA3": "It's a risk, but I'll get us more light.",
    "80FF4FA5": "Guardian, we have to go!",
    "80FF4FA7": "It's time to move, Guardian!",
    "80FF4FA9": "Hard military system: Check. Frayed wires and rust: Check. When I flip this switch, expect trouble.",
    "80FF4FAB": "Careful. They're all around us.",
    "80FF4FAD": "The Fallen are Scavengers—alien pirates picking at humanity's remains.",
    "80FF4FAF": "A Sniper Rifle! That'll do some damage.",
    "80FF4FB1": "Let's take a look at your new ship.",
    "80FF4FB3": "Not good! Not good! They're definitely not happy to see us.",
    "80FF4FB5": "Heads up!",
    "80FF4FB7": "A Fallen raiding party! We're in more trouble than I thought.",
    "80FF4FB9": "Here we go! Let's take that ship!",
    "80FF4FBB": "Look out! They're dropping a Walker!",
    "80FF4FBD": "A Bow! That'll do some damage.",
    "80FF4FBF": "I need to get you back to the City. To do that, we'll need a ship.",
    "80FF4FC1": "But first, I need to find you a weapon. Let's keep moving.",
    "80FF4FC3": "Keep pushing forward.",
    "80FF4FC5": "I'll locate a ship we can use to fly home.",
    "80FF4FC7": "Everything looks like rust and ruin, but if we can get out of here, you'll see wonders you can't imagine.",
    "80FF4FC9": "Hundreds of years ago people came here to escape the end of the world. Most didn't make it.",
    "80FF4FEB": "Cayde was always precious with his treasures. Hid them throughout the system. ",
    "80FF4FEF": "I wonder how much of his secrecy was for safety, and how much was for fun. ",
    "80FF4FF1": "Cayde would've liked you. You have his explorer's spirit, and you're not afraid to take risks.",
    "80FF4FF3": "Careful now.",
    "80FF4FF5": "We're almost there. Keep climbing.",
    "80FF4FF7": "The math says, even those closest to Cayde will never find all of his stashes.",
    "80FF4FF9": "The rumors of his misadventures don't even scratch the surface of the trouble he got up to.",
    "80FF4FFB": "Maybe if Sundance were still with us But",
    "80FF4FFD": "The memories of those we care for only hurt because we care",
    "80FF4FFF": "Anyway we've gotta be close.",
    "80FF5001": "The math says, even those closest to Cayde will never find all of his stashes.",
    "80FF5003": "The rumors of his misadventures don't even scratch the surface of the trouble he got up to.",
    "80FF5005": "But who knows? Your legend is just getting started, Guardian.",
    "80FF5007": "Maybe someday it'll be your adventures that inspire a new generation of heroes and explorers.",
    "80FF5009": "Banshee's memory isn't what it used to be.",
    "80FF500B": "But I think he's sending us to one of Cayde's old stashes.",
    "80FF500D": "Hmm. The last piece of your Riskrunner being hidden away by the biggest risk taker we've ever met is almost poetic.",
    "80FF500F": "Banshee's memory isn't what it used to be.",
    "80FF5011": "I think he's sending us to one of the old Hunter Vanguard's secret stashes.",
    "80FF5013": "You never met Cayde-6 He was a bit of a wild card—and a friend.",
    "80FF5015": "It's fitting that he's still helping Guardians, even after his death.",
    "80FF5017": "Banshee's notes mentioned a locked door 'near the gap.'",
    "80FF5019": "That's the door. Use the Ether key to pop the lock.",
    "80FF501B": "The only other note is: 'Chasm. Have fun.'",
    "80FF501D": "If we're hunting for one of Cayde's stashes Those three words are a threat followed by sarcasm.",
    "80FF501F": "Watch your angles. The fall will probably kill you.",
    "80FF5021": "We're hunting Dusk Captains! Kill the Mechanics to draw them out.",
    "80FF5023": "There's a Fallen raiding party out there!",
    "80FF5025": "I'd say something about risk versus reward, but that seems too obvious.",
    "80FF5027": "We've got what we need. Let's move!",
    "80FF5029": "We can't leave that Walker intact.",
    "80FF502B": "Your arsenal keeps growing, Guardian.",
    "80FF502D": "Some of the technology in your hands is as advanced as the Golden Age.",
    "80FF502F": "Which is to say: Watch where you point that thing.",
    "80FF5031": "Light 'em up!",
    "80FF5033": "Another gift from an old friend. Thanks, Cayde.",
    "80FF5035": "Banshee was right. His 'funny, chicken-loving' friend left us a present.",
    "80FF5349": "I'm gettin' the same weird as the last place, but the signal's real faint.",
    "80FF534C": "Well, if I learned anything from science class, it's that you change as few variables as possible.",
    "80FF534D": "That means wearin' your mask again. Just pretend you're puttin' on a show for the City kids.",
    "80FF534E": "Yep, I saw what you saw. That cinches it.",
    "80FF534F": "This is worse than regular weird: it's Vex weird and Taken weird.",
    "80FF5350": "Get back here when you can. We gotta figure this out.",
    "80FF5351": "Lockin' down your coordinates. Ooh, the Sanctum of Bones, huh? [laugh] Way to get into the holiday spirit.",
    "80FF5352": "I remember Asher sayin' there's a nest o' Taken in there. Hoo, even more creepy. I love it!",
    "80FF5353": "Anyway, get in there and show 'em what's what.",
    "80FF5354": "That sounded like a lot o' shootin' and then somethin' weird.",
    "80FF5355": "Same kind of signal we used to get off you when you were runnin' around Mercury.",
    "80FF5357": "Do me a favor. Go hit the other Lost Sector nearby. And check in with me before you go inside, 'kay?",
    "80FF53C6": "Zavala. This whole sphere is a dedicated processing structure. A giant Vex computational array.",
    "80FF53CA": "What could the Taken want with a Vex computer?",
    "80FF53CC": "The Taken want nothing.",
    "80FF53CE": "Eris. Eavesdropping, I see.",
    "80FF53D0": "Don't bother guessing at the Taken's intentions. Ask instead what is sought by the hand that directs them.",
    "80FF53D2": "Not long ago, we detected a massive burst of Vex activity on Io. Inside the Pyramidion.",
    "80FF53D4": "We need eyes in that structure, Guardian. Get moving.",
    "80FF53D6": "We've discovered the cause of the Vex high alert.",
    "80FF53D8": "There's a Taken incursion in progress inside the Pyramidion.",
    "80FF53DA": "Taken. Any sense of their objective?",
    "80FF53DC": "Unclear for the moment. Stand by.",
    "80FF53DE": "Taken influence is thicker down here. They're not trying to break in—they're infesting from the inside out.",
    "80FF53E0": "There must be some anchoring Blight nearby. If we're really unlucky a portal to an Ascendant Realm.",
    "80FF53E2": "There. That must be the anchor—the Taken's route into the sphere. Destroy it!",
    "80FF53E4": "There's a giant Vex sphere in this chamber.",
    "80FF53E6": "Like the ones on Nessus, but colossal.",
    "80FF53E8": "And there's a door leading inside. That could very well be the Taken's objective.",
    "80FF53EA": "Their first major offensive since the Dreaming City. ",
    "80FF53EC": "Get inside that sphere. We need to know what they're after.",
    "80FF53EE": "Io's been fairly quiet since you dealt with the Genesis Mind.",
    "80FF53F0": "Io's been fairly quiet since we dealt with the Genesis Mind.",
    "80FF53F2": "Systems that have been dark for years have sprung to life.",
    "80FF53F4": "That ended a few hours ago, when Asher Mir warned us of spiking energy levels across the Pyramidion.",
    "80FF53F6": "The Vex are on high alert. Asher suggested his 'able assistant' find out why. I was inclined to agree.",
    "80FF53F8": "Of course he did. You can count on us, Commander. ",
    "80FF53FA": "The Vex are on high alert. We need to know why.",
    "80FF53FC": "You can count on us. We're making our descent now.",
    "80FF53FE": "This Blight does it look familiar to you? Like the Blight in the Dreaming City?",
    "80FF5400": "This Blight bears a signature that is eerily similar to those found in the Dreaming City.",
    "80FF5402": "Savathûn extends her reach at last.",
    "80FF5404": "Savathûn? What makes you so certain?",
    "80FF5406": "There's no certainty where the Witch Queen is concerned. But I have strong suspicions.",
    "80FF5408": "Above all, she seeks knowledge to inform her plans and seeks pawns to carry them out. The sphere offers both.",
    "80FF540A": "Last time the Taken made a play at the Pyramidion, they sought to infect the Vex network.",
    "80FF540C": "This attack seems more precise. Targeted. But why?",
    "80FF540E": "Where her brother failed, Savathûn seeks reprisal. For the moment, this is all we can hope to know.",
    "80FF5410": "Speculation only strengthens the Witch Queen. Thwarting her designs is what matters now.",
    "80FF5412": "If the Taken are finally mounting assaults beyond the Dreaming City, Io's just the beginning.",
    "80FF5414": "Indeed. They are driven by grander ambitions. But these designs are beyond our reach for now.",
    "80FF5416": "Savathûn sows chaos and confusion with every motion. Until her plans truly unfurl, we can do little more than react.",
    "80FF5418": "Every square inch of interior surface area in this sphere is coursing with energy.",
    "80FF541A": "Let me see what I can find out. Scanning",
    "80FF541C": "We killed the Taken commander and secured the central sphere. I think the Vex can handle the rest. ",
    "80FF541E": "Savathûn is gathering her strength, Zavala. If we hope to survive what's to come, we must prepare.",
    "80FF5420": "We defeated Oryx. If Savathûn wants a fight, she'll get one. ",
    "80FF5422": "She is not as foolhardy as her brother. She would never risk a direct confrontation.",
    "80FF5424": "We will know her next move only when she makes it—and only if we're wise enough to recognize it.",
    "80FF551D": "Dark Age was different times. We had no City.",
    "80FF5521": "Warlords and Iron Lords tore up the whole world tryin' to prove who was better, what was worth fighting for.",
    "80FF5523": "I was busy tryin' not to starve. You ever go hungry 'til you keeled over? We did that a lot in the Dark Age. ",
    "80FF5525": "Our Ghosts would bring us back—still hungry. Really pissed me off.",
    "80FF5527": "This one time I found a village to hide out in. Bunch of huts, really. Good people. ",
    "80FF5529": "They gave me work, and I kept my Light a secret while I performed some minor miracles. ",
    "80FF552B": "Then the Iron Lords rolled into town. My Ghost stayed outta sight, and they were none the wiser. ",
    "80FF552D": "They cut a deal with us (as if we had a choice)—paid us to let them hide out 'til some Warlords showed up. Then ambushed 'em.",
    "80FF552F": "But we all got caught in the crossfire.",
    "80FF5531": "My neighbor's kid told me something that still bounces 'round my head to this day.",
    "80FF5533": "Right before the light went out in her tiny eyes, she whispered, 'I can't feel anything.'",
    "80FF5535": "Yeah. I couldn't either.",
    "80FF5537": "That's all I got. Cut the tape.",
    "80FF553C": "Hey, kid. It's me. The Drifter. And this is 'How to Drift,' Part Three: Never Trust Your Ghost.",
    "80FF5540": "He's a tool. A connection to the Light. Not a friend—not in any way that counts. ",
    "80FF5542": "You think he's saving your hide, bringing you back? He's saving his own.",
    "80FF5544": "I don't care what your Guardian dogma says. I don't care what your little buddy has told you. ",
    "80FF5546": "We don't know what Ghosts are. They sound friendly, right?",
    "80FF5548": "But I met some Ghosts in the Dark Age would kill you for a blue engram. Then spit on your grave. ",
    "80FF554A": "All so they could grow their Light a little more. Make a 'stronger connection to the Traveler.'",
    "80FF554C": "Whatever the hell that means.",
    "80FF554E": "You're an idiot if you think those Ghosts aren't still around.",
    "80FF5550": "Take mine, for example. Really creeps me out",
    "80FF5552": "Cut the tape, Ghost. And don't gimme that look. You know where we stand.",
    "80FF5557": "If you're gonna hang with me, you need to know about the Shadows of Yor.",
    "80FF555B": "They follow the edicts of a very bad man named Dredgen Yor. And what're his Shadows after? ",
    "80FF555D": "Everything the Light can't provide. I thought they could help me find an answer to the battles of Light versus Light that raged during the Dark Age. ",
    "80FF555F": "But the longer I flew with them, the more I saw they're blind as all those who follow the Traveler. One albatross for another.",
    "80FF5561": "I was done with 'em.",
    "80FF5563": "And that title I give out? Dredgen? I did it to piss them off. Draw the Shadows out where I could see 'em.",
    "80FF5565": "Worked like a charm. I love all you lil' Guardians. You're so forthright. So eager to please.",
    "80FF5567": "That make you angry? Good. Use it.",
    "80FF556C": "You can't be the Drifter's partner and not know about Shin Malphur.",
    "80FF5570": "The Man with the Golden Gun is still out there. He's a hero. The stuff of legend.",
    "80FF5572": "Naturally, he's after my Ghost. He wouldn't be the first.",
    "80FF5574": "But everyone and their grandma has a Malfeasance Hand Cannon by now. I think we're OK if Mr. Malphur ever shows his face.",
    "80FF5576": "He follows the Light like a zealot, and he ends all those who would consort with the dark because of one man who went rogue.",
    "80FF5578": "It's not his Golden Gun you should be afraid of, kid. It's his idea that one man can decide he makes the rules, and when you cross him, he can take everything from you.",
    "80FF557A": "Doesn't sit right with me. Never will.",
    "80FF557F": "Mighty kind of the Vanguard to let me sleep in the Annex. Doesn't get cold down there. Much.",
    "80FF5583": "Do I trust them for it? Hell no. They're gettin' people killed just like the Iron Lords. Yes, people. Like you and me.",
    "80FF5585": "Just 'cuz we got the Light doesn't mean we ever stop bein' that. Don't you let them tell you otherwise.",
    "80FF5587": "And that mission statement of theirs? Protecting the City? Heh.",
    "80FF5589": "Humanity's done, kid. You can't save 'em. ",
    "80FF558B": "Even if you could wrap a Ward of Dawn around this whole town, they'd start dying all on their own. ",
    "80FF558D": "Every single one you save becomes just a memory. I don't need any more of those.",
    "80FF558F": "You'll get there. You'll see.",
    "80FF5594": "I thought the City had made you all soft. But there's this hardliner—a Warlock named Aunor.",
    "80FF5598": "Pretty sure she's trying to kill me.",
    "80FF559A": "She crashed a handoff between me and the Shadows of Yor in Midtown. My, uh, buddies took a hostage, and she took out a City block getting them back. ",
    "80FF559C": "Some people didn't make it out. How's that for hypocrisy?",
    "80FF559E": "She jumped the shark on that one. I woulda' talked them down.",
    "80FF55A0": "No one had to get hurt. I hope the Vanguard are happy.",
    "80FF55A2": "I heard word from Hunter dens across the City. This Aunor's been building a crew to look into me and the Shadows.",
    "80FF55A4": "Buncha clowns. One'a them is this Guardian—a hero of the Red War, just like you—one'a Cayde's friends just like you. ",
    "80FF55A6": "A Gambit regular. 'Cept they're a snitch. Have been all this time.",
    "80FF55A8": "I don't mind. As long as they keep bringing Motes, we're square.",
    "80FF55AA": "You watch your back out there, partner. Your friends might not be what they seem.",
    "80FF55AF": "Hey, you made it to the last part of my lil' seminar. You caught me without much else to say. Already talked your ear off.",
    "80FF55B3": "But I guess there is one thing. I want you to know that you're the closest thing to a wheel-horse I've had in, oh, a thousand years.",
    "80FF55B5": "I can see you making that face like you just swallowed some Scorn blood. 'Wheel-horse' is an expression, kid.",
    "80FF55B7": "It's Dark Age for 'we're tight.' That's what you kids say, right?",
    "80FF55B9": "So here's something I never had the chance to tell anyone else on account of they're dead or tryin'a kill me.",
    "80FF55BB": "Don't give in to hope. That gets you killed. Take every day as it is. Trade your jumpship for a long-range hauler and see the universe while you can.",
    "80FF55BD": "I want the best for you, kid. And you won't find that in this system.",
    "80FF55BF": "Speaking of which. The Collapse wasn't the last extinction-level event to hit humanity. ",
    "80FF55C1": "Ol' Drifter's seen another one comin'. Everything I'm building in the Nine Realms is preparation.",
    "80FF55C3": "There's a few seats I'm savin'. One of 'em is for you. If you want it.",
    "80FF5B1B": "That's right! You drain those Motes!",
    "80FF5B1F": "You're a Blocker now! Give 'em hell!",
    "80FF5B21": "You're drainin' Motes! Delicious!",
    "80FF5B23": "You're bleedin' Motes, brother! Whack the Blockers!",
    "80FF5B25": "Motes draining! The Blockers must die, brother!",
    "80FF5B27": "Hey, you're losin' Motes! Ice the Blockers!",
    "80FF5B29": "Watch it! You're sheddin' Motes! Kill the Blockers!",
    "80FF5B2B": "Woo! Giant Blocker outbound! They don't get bigger than that!",
    "80FF5B2D": "Big boy Taken outbound! You're messed up, haha.",
    "80FF5B2F": "Giant Blocker outbound! Haha, what the hell, man.",
    "80FF5B31": "Giant-sized blocker out! Cayde would say well, nothin'! Haha!",
    "80FF5B33": "Giant Blocker out! You know the Vanguard would hate this, right?",
    "80FF5B35": "Giant Blocker outbound! You're a terrible friend—but you'll get paid!",
    "80FF5B37": "Giant Blocker deployed! Shaxx would yell at you. And then punch your Blocker in the neck. [laughs]",
    "80FF5B39": "All right! Supercharge your Light, and let that Primeval have it!",
    "80FF5B3B": "Cook up some supercharged Light and feed it to that Primeval!",
    "80FF5B3D": "Your Light reading's off the charts! Tear the Primeval to pieces!",
    "80FF5B3F": "All right! Feed your Light to that Primeval!",
    "80FF5B41": "Make that Primeval eat your Light!",
    "80FF5B43": "Your Light's supercharged! Turn up the heat on that Primeval!",
    "80FF5B45": "You've weaponized your Light! Cook that Primeval! Drifter's hungry!",
    "80FF5B47": "Target marked! Nice!",
    "80FF5B49": "Your target's marked.",
    "80FF5B4B": "Target's not gettin' away!",
    "80FF5B4D": "Motes mean a lot more to me than power these days. The window's closin'. Ol' Drifter's gotta get under it.",
    "80FF5B4F": "See, the Vanguard don't appreciate you like I do. You kill yourself out here everyday. Drifter knows it. I'mma pay you now.",
    "80FF5B51": "I like you. Every hole Drifter digs himself into, you dig him out. Haha. Let's get you paid.",
    "80FF5B53": "Every score you finish out here gets Drifter one step closer to salvation. Glad to have you on the crew, brother.",
    "80FF5B55": "You work so fast, I figured I'd find a place that never ran out of things to kill. But you outpaced Gambit Prime, too. Show-off.",
    "80FF5B57": "You went to war out there. Always wondered what that would look like. And I was right. Other side didn't stand a chance.",
    "80FF5B59": "Gambit don't scare you. Prime don't scare you. I like your style, but Brother, you're nuts.",
    "80FF5B5B": "Lotta Motes. Lotta Motes. Nice. This is all going toward a good cause. Trust.",
    "80FF5B5D": "You were mean out there. Downright mean. I knew I liked you. Come back and let's count your share.",
    "80FF5B5F": "The Shadows of Yor got nothin' on you. Woo! I'mma call you next time they roll around.",
    "80FF5B61": "I'll need a gun like you someday soon. Real soon. Your Ghost has my feed. Keep in touch.",
    "80FF5B63": "Gambit's been leadin' to this. Payouts today will go directly to the Drifter preservation fund. Haha.",
    "80FF5B65": "Pretty soon, I'll have everything I'll need. Good work today. Go home and count your money while you can, heh.",
    "80FF5B67": "You know, after you betrayed me, I thought I wouldn't like you much anymore. But I feel a little better every Mote you bring back. Haha.",
    "80FF5B69": "Nice work. You know, this little tiff we got going is stupid. Why don't we make amends, say you trust me again? No? Haha. Well, I had to try.",
    "80FF5B6B": "Good work. The Shadows of Yor are comin'. The Man with the Golden Gun, too. And who knows what else is out there? All of this helps. Trust.",
    "80FF5B6D": "You told the Vanguard 'bout Gambit. You tell 'em about this, too? I thought all this was our little secret. Shucks.",
    "80FF5B6F": "Hey, you may be a rat man, but today you were my rat man. Go count your money.",
    "80FF5B71": "You're an overachieving Collector! Bring those Motes home!",
    "80FF5B73": "You got Motes comin' outta every pore! Bank 'em!",
    "80FF5B75": "You're at max Motes, Collector! Bank!",

    "80FF5B79": "Brother, you've got that edge.",
    "80FF5B7B": "Yes sir, that's Gambit Prime well played.",
    "80FF5B7D": "You found your equilibrium. And it's deadly.",
    "80FF5B7F": "With you around, how many Hive gods are left?",
    "80FF5B81": "Primeval's dead. You survived another one.",
    "80FF5B83": "Primeval's dead. Light and Dark don't matter.",
    "80FF5B85": "Primeval's down. Balance is everything.",
    "80FF5B87": "Primeval's dead. Doin' righteous work, kid.",

    "80FF5BA1": "Prime's over. Your enemy's got good flow.",
    "80FF5BA3": "Gambit Prime's done. Your enemy found the balance—killed their Primeval.",
    "80FF5BA5": "And that's Prime. Opponents put their Primeval on ice.",
    "80FF5BA7": "It's done. Opposing team crushed their Primeval.",
    "80FF5BA9": "Gambit Prime's finished. Your enemy ripped their Primeval to pieces.",
    "80FF5BAB": "That's it. Enemy Primeval down.",
    "80FF5BAD": "Prime's done. Opposing team knocked out their Primeval.",
    "80FF5BAF": "Can't win every fight, brother. But you'll get paid for your time. Come see me again.",
    "80FF5BB1": "Hey, don't be down. This is important work. Got more of it for you soon. Come back when you're ready.",
    "80FF5BB3": "Hey, you lost. Not the end of the world. That only happens if you don't come back. Drifter can't go on without ya. Come back soon.",
    "80FF5BB5": "Hey, hey. Everybody loses. Everyone here is a veteran scumbag. Including you. You'll kill 'em next time, OK?",
    "80FF5BB7": "The other team was pretty good. No one's gonna slum it here. You know where to find me if you're lookin' for another fight.",
    "80FF5BB9": "It's over, but this doesn't have to be the last match. Ol' Drifter always needs more Motes, brother.",
    "80FF5BBB": "Hey, you got to lose some time. Those guys over there? Professional killers, all of 'em. Just like you. So you count your loot, and come back when you're ready.",
    "80FF5BBD": "There are bullets out there for each of us, and one found you today. S'all good. Come back when you can.",
    "80FF5BBF": "Nobody wins all the time. 'Cept Ikora. And even she lost the Tower. Come back when you can.",
    "80FF5BC1": "Hey, you lost. You care? I don't. This is important work, and I need you on it. Come back when you can.",
    "80FF5BC3": "Winning wasn't in the cards for you. But hey, you got some loot, and a reason to be angry. Come back and take it out on the next team.",
    "80FF5BC5": "You watch those fronts. You watch your back.",

    "80FF5BED": "I heard the Thanatonauts are letting Invaders kill them out there. Let's hope you see one, huh?",
    "80FF5BEF": "The greatest threat to another Guardian is you, brother. Let's see you invade!",
    "80FF5BF1": "You're an Invader! My favorite. You people are psychos.",
    "80FF5BF3": "I love Invaders on the field! Aim for the head!",

    "80FF5BF9": "You're geared to Collect, huh? My favorite kinda guy. Get to it.",
    "80FF5BFB": "A Collector. Don't let the Invaders tell you otherwise. You're the real heroes.",
    "80FF5BFD": "Hey. Anything touches my bank, you break its legs, got it?",
    "80FF5BFF": "Sentry is the most important role. Don't let 'em tell you different. You're guardin' my bank!",
    "80FF5C01": "You defend that bank with your life, y'hear? You got plenty of lives!",
    "80FF5C03": "Anyone gets near the bank, and you promise me you'll punch 'em in the eye!",
    "80FF5C05": "A Sentry on the field! You watch that bank, y'hear? Ol' Drifter needs those Motes!",
    "80FF5C07": "Invader marked. Hunt 'em.",

    "80FF5C14": "Dark Ether in Scorn can't be controlled. Not even with Motes. Get rid of 'em.",
    "80FF5C18": "The Fanatic can bring Scorn back. Gotta open that guy up. See what's inside.",
    "80FF5C1A": "Mark my words. One day I will find the courage to eat a whole Scorn.",

    "80FF5C26": "Motes of Dark have no effect on Scorn—not even with all that cursed Ether inside.",
    "80FF5C28": "I lie about the Scorn in Gambit. They DO scare me. Heh, shucks.",

    "80FF6CD0": "The shape has but two faces: the drive to exist and the will to survive at any cost. No reason. No teleology. And critically, no Oryx.",
    "80FF6CD2": "There is only the shape—the unceasing engine, end unto itself.",
    "80FF6CD4": "The logic abhors necromancy. That which dies does not deserve to live. ",
    "80FF6CD6": "Yet in this place, the Swarm seek to subvert this foundational tenet. They must not succeed.",
    "80FF6CD8": "Oryx lives on through his mighty vanquisher. Through you. But instead of seizing his mantle, you walked away. ",
    "80FF6CDA": "Look around you. Behold the price of your arrogance.",
    "80FF6CDC": "Oryx lives on through his mighty vanquishers: the Guardians. But his mantle lay abandoned. Look around you. ",
    "80FF6CDE": "Behold the cost of such arrogance.",
    "80FF6CE0": "They whisper of you as the whetstone—the wheel upon which all the blades of the Swarm are honed.",
    "80FF6CE2": "They hate you and are grateful to you, in equal measure.",
    "80FF6CE4": "If any piece of Oryx yet exists, it screams for the end of this heresy. Exact his will. Be his sword.",
    "80FF6CE6": "Somewhere, buried in rubble, a dark heart boils with rage. ",
    "80FF6CE8": "I hold you responsible for the rise of this aberration, oh opener of vacancies. ",
    "80FF6CEA": "But I must confess that I'm curious to see where this will lead. What madness will follow.",
    "80FF6CEC": "I hold Guardians responsible for this aberration, but I must confess that I'm quite curious to see where this will lead. What madness will follow. ",
    "80FF6CEE": "The real power of Nightmares comes from their point of origin: the human mind. Memory distorts and embellishes our greatest traumas. ",
    "80FF6CF0": "The heretics thus ask, what in all creation could be greater than Oryx, if not the memory of him? ",
    "80FF6D1C": "In the depths of the Prison of Elders, the Fanatic found his calling. ",
    "80FF6D20": "With his fellow Barons by his side, the Fanatic murdered Cayde-6 on the orders of the former Prince of the Reef, Uldren Sov.",
    "80FF6D22": "The Fanatic was able to resurrect the dead. It's only fitting the Pyramid would do the same for him.",
    "80FF6D24": "We hunted the Fanatic down. His Nightmare will feel the same pain.",
    "80FF6D26": "The Fanatic paid for his crimes with his life. His Nightmare will pay all the same.",
    "80FF6D28": "Eris, we've downed another Nightmare of the Fanatic.",
    "80FF6D2A": "With every defeated Nightmare, the Pyramid grows weaker, and we grow stronger. Fine work.",
    "80FF6D50": "We've silenced Omnigul's screams before. We'll do it again.",
    "80FF6D54": "Let's silence Omnigul's piercing screams.",
    "80FF6D56": "Eris, the Nightmare of Omnigul is taken care of. For now, anyway.",
    "80FF6D58": "Did you retrieve any further Essence?",
    "80FF6D5A": "We did. This time unique to this Nightmare.",
    "80FF6D5C": "I see. Then we will uncover its secrets together.",
    "80FF6D5E": "Until then, the Hive await you inside the Scarlet Keep. Let me know what you find within.",
    "80FF6D60": "Blind devotion is a dangerous thing, but when it came to Crota, Omnigul knew no other way.",
    "80FF6D62": "She raised for him an army of Hive and tore apart throngs of Guardians. ",
    "80FF6D64": "Omnigul left much suffering in her wake. Suffering the Pyramid now uses against us.",

    "80FF6D74": "We threw sword logic in Crota's face and proved he wasn't a god after all.",
    "80FF6D76": "When Crota fell at the hands of Guardians, it was clear he wasn't a god after all.",
    "80FF6D78": "Let's take the Crota Nightmare down.",
    "80FF6D7A": "Crota. Son of Oryx. He considered himself a god, and acted as such.",
    "80FF6D7C": "His strength proved too much for my fireteam and I. He and his brood took their lives and left me nearly dead.",
    "80FF6D7E": "Crota threatened all we had left. The Pyramid serves to do the same.",
    "80FF6D80": "It is no surprise Crota haunts us once again.",
    "80FF6D9D": "Crota's Brood had an appetite for destruction that knew no bounds.",
    "80FF6DA1": "Thus, Phogoth, the Untamed was created. To enact the will of evil upon all.",
    "80FF6DA3": "Were he to have succeeded, we might not stand here today.",
    "80FF6DA5": "Phogoth is fear incarnate. There's no Nightmare more fitting for the Pyramid to bring forth.",
    "80FF6DA7": "And no Nightmare more fitting for you to slaughter.",
    "80FF6DA9": "The Nightmare of Phogoth is no more, Eris.",
    "80FF6DAB": "And we grow stronger yet.",
    "80FF6DAD": "Phogoth didn't scare us before. This time is no different.",
    "80FF6DAF": "That's the Nightmare of Phogoth. Let's get it.",
    "80FF6DB5": "There's the Nightmare of Taniks. Let's take it down.",
    "80FF6DB9": "Taniks put up a fight. But we got him in the end, Eris.",
    "80FF6DBB": "Good. We draw closer to the Pyramid with every victory.",
    "80FF6DBD": "Years ago, Taniks tore the Vanguard apart over a mere bounty. Andal Brask was murdered in cold blood, and the Hunter Vanguard was left without a leader.",
    "80FF6DBF": "Taniks would ultimately die for this on the orders of Cayde-6. But the scars he left among all Guardians would never fully heal.",
    "80FF6DC1": "Once again, the Pyramid takes advantage of our collective pain.",
    "80FF6DC3": "We will not succumb.",
    "80FF6DD9": "Skolas Nightmare, dead ahead. It's ours.",
    "80FF6DDD": "Eris, Skolas has been taken care of.",
    "80FF6DDF": "Good work, Guardian. All that awaits us now is the Pyramid itself.",
    "80FF6DE1": "Find me when you are ready.",
    "80FF6DE3": "We are all consumed by that which eats away at us. For Skolas, it was his own hubris.",
    "80FF6DE5": "He pursued complete control over all Houses of the Fallen, and through his misguided conquest, many perished.",
    "80FF6DE7": "Skolas's memory serves as a permanent reminder of all the lives lost at the whim of a single Kell.",
    "80FF6DE9": "No matter how hard the Pyramid may try, we will not cower.",
    "80FF6DEF": "We ended Ghaul's reign. His Nightmare stands no chance.",
    "80FF6DF3": "Ghaul lost his life in the shadow of the Traveler. His Nightmare is about to suffer the same.",
    "80FF6DF5": "Eris, that's another Nightmare of Ghaul down.",
    "80FF6DF7": "As long as the Pyramid continues to throw them at us, we will be here to beat them back. Good work.",
    "80FF6DF9": "The Red Legion arrived and gifted us with a collective pain—the loss of our Light. For a time, all Guardians knew my pain.",
    "80FF6DFB": "Too many lost their lives. Those left standing will forever harbor the incurable guilt of survival.",
    "80FF6DFD": "I left the City just before the war for reasons of my own. But I harbor that guilt all the same.",
    "80FF6DFF": "Even simply a visage of Ghaul is unacceptable. The Pyramid knows this. It feeds off this. ",
    "80FF6E01": "Do not let it win.",
    "80FF6E2A": "Zydron. The Vex Gate Lord who denied Guardians access to the Black Garden. The very place from which the Traveler's pain arose.",
    "80FF6E2E": "The Pyramid uses Zydron's very presence as a reminder of the fear we faced when the Traveler's existence was threatened.",
    "80FF6E30": "Silence his Nightmare.",
    "80FF6E32": "Eris, we've put the Nightmare of Zydron to rest.",
    "80FF6E34": "The Pyramid's distractions prove weak, time and again. The next time will be no different.",
    "80FF6E36": "We tore Zydron's head from his body.",
    "80FF6E38": "Zydron lost his head to brave Guardians.",
    "80FF6E3A": "We'll defeat his Nightmare all the same.",
    "80FF6ED2": "Eris, we found it. It appears to be a ritual of some kind.",
    "80FF6ED6": "We must learn its purpose. Do not be afraid to engage the Hive. ",
    "80FF6ED8": "Eris, we found something. It appears to be a Hive ritual site of some kind.",
    "80FF6EDA": "We must learn its purpose. Investigate with caution.",
    "80FF6EDC": "All right, Eris. Where to?",
    "80FF6EDE": "The Pyramid's warding is only a temporary inconvenience. We must first understand how it works if we're to pass through it.",
    "80FF6EE0": "For that, the Hive may provide answers. For eons, they've lived next to the Pyramid.",
    "80FF6EE2": "And now the've constructed that Scarlet Keep above it.",
    "80FF6EE4": "Its existence was clearly no secret to them.",
    "80FF6EE6": "Now that it's activated, strange congregations of Hive have begun to appear on the Moon. There is undoubtedly a connection.",
    "80FF6EE8": "Then that's where we start.",
    "80FF6EEA": "Eris, It's the Nightmares. The Hive are trying to draw them in for the ritual.",
    "80FF6EEC": "How curious For what purpose?",
    "80FF6EEE": "It's unclear. But they don't seem affected by the Nightmares at all. Not like we are.",
    "80FF6EF0": "Fascinating. We must learn how they've achieved that. That's our key to finding a way beyond the Pyramid's war— ",
    "80FF6EF2": "Eris?!",
    "80FF6EF4": "Those screams sounded familiar. Almost like Omnigul.",
    "80FF6EF6": "Those screams. That's a Hive Wizard.",
    "80FF6EF8": "We have to hurry.",
    "80FF6EFB": "The song remains unbound. There are notes yet to steal and bone yet to defile.",
    "80FF6EFF": "Toland knows the way. His madness is your truth.",
    "80FF6F01": "Heed his warnings and know that your suffering will become your strength",

    "80FF6F05": "Welcome, once more, to the edge of oblivion, hero.",
    "80FF6F07": "You have faced much—enough to impress the easily impressed—but the melody we seek to cage may be more than you can overcome.",
    "80FF6F09": "Is that concern I hear in the old man's voice? Maybe his humanity isn't lost after all.",
    "80FF6F0B": "My concern extends only to all we gain to learn from what comes next.",
    "80FF6F0D": "Succeed or fail, Guardian. Either way, new understandings will be gleaned from your courage.",
    "80FF6F0F": "Beyond, the choir awaits. Quiet the Aria before they shred your mind and rend your flesh.",
    "80FF6F11": "The song's embrace will be harsh, but remember Every note you endure will lead to the Hive's undoing.",
    "80FF6F13": "Here, Guardian.",
    "80FF6F15": "I came to the Moon with Eris and other lost warriors not to end the Nightmares, but to meet them—understand them.",
    "80FF6F17": "From that understanding, I expected to conquer their horrors and safeguard our past, present, and future.",
    "80FF6F19": "But the Hive are not simply waking terror. They are a dark mirror—a reflection of all we fear to face in ourselves.",
    "80FF6F1B": "Crota, Oryx, the Worm Gods, the Ascendent Plane they are so much more than enemies and the unknowable.",
    "80FF6F1D": "They are teachers. The fear they sow: a lesson—a path toward an evolution.",
    "80FF6F1F": "We must tear every instrument of death they wield from their hearts, minds, and hands and remake them to inflict our will.",
    "80FF6F21": "The will of the Light. The will of life.",
    "80FF6F23": "Are your ears bleeding yet? The last skull we need is just ahead.",
    "80FF6F25": "Then the song is ours—and death, once more, yours to command.",
    "80FF6F27": "Kill the Deathsinger. End her lullaby.",

    "80FFEBEE": "Crota may be gone, but the Swarm lives on.",
    "80FFEBF0": "Though many souls were silenced at the Great Disaster, their memories lingered. A fire was born in the heart of Praxic Warlock Eriana-3. ",
    "80FFEBF2": "She fought the day of our disaster, lost one of her closest friends, and retreated alongside the survivors.",
    "80FFEEC3": "But her Light remained. And she vowed vengeance upon Crota.",
    "80FFEED3": "Eris—at the time, unbroken—together with Eriana-3 sought vengeance upon Crota. ",

    "80FFEF4F": "Overwhelmed and smothered by Thrall, his Light was snuffed out. If only he'd listened. What a waste.",
    "80FFEF51": "In the quest to fell Crota, we brought with us the desire for vengeance. We brought ego.",
    "80FFEF54": "But with me, I brought curiosity. Reverence. Fascination. And as such, here I sit, my soul still bound to existence.",
    "80FFEF56": "With the exception of Eris, I can't say the same for the rest.",
    "80FFEF58": "All the Guardians lost here on this dead orb. All the Hive destroyed by our push against their dark will. So much loss on both sides.",
    "80FFEF5A": "And always the Fallen, there to pick at the carnage, the scrap—surviving, thriving on the waste of this unending war we call existence. ",
    "80FFEF5C": "There was a crew of Fallen who took to the Hive's sword logic. They are all dead now—by their own hands.",
    "80FFEF5E": "They sought Ascension, but understood nothing of its meaning. I watched as they slaughtered one another over the course of months. ",
    "80FFEF60": "The last of them, with no crew left to lead, walked to Hellmouth's edge and cast himself into the depths.  ",
    "80FFEF62": "The Fallen's obsession with Luna has cost them much. ",
    "80FFEF64": "They come to pillage the remains of human innovation and pick at the Hive's arcana.",
    "80FFEF66": "But I have yet to understand what drives them to take such a risk when there are other worlds more easily scavenged.",
    "80FFEF68": "Before Crota's death, the Hive viewed the Fallen as nothing more than an annoyance.",
    "80FFEF6A": "But now, as they struggle to regain their purpose, the Hive have no patience for distraction.",
    "80FFEF6C": "This has led to a renewed conflict as both fight to survive in the face of sustained Guardian aggression.",
    "80FFEF6E": "I offer no set conclusions, but it is my belief that the Fallen dare plunder the Hellmouth's depth.",
    "80FFEF70": "They know the value in mastering the strange science of their enemy—be it Hive, Human, Vex, or Cabal.",
    "80FFEF72": "They risk much to steal pieces of understanding from us all, until that time when they no longer fear extinction but inflict it.",
    "80FFEF74": "In our own time of need, we failed ourselves. Crota struck us down en masse and destroyed much of what was built here, Moonbase included.",
    "80FFEF76": "The Traveler had come, it had brought us into a Golden Age. And yet little from that era mattered in the shadow of Crota.",
    "80FFEF78": "There were those who believed that in Crota, the end had come. From the Moonbase, they cried out for help.  ",
    "80FFEF7A": "Their message beamed far and across the system. It would land with those who would not respond. Deemed to be only 'affairs of the City.'",
    "80FFEF7C": "Beyond that day, the Vanguard would learn the true power of Crota's Will. Of realms between reality and the great beyond.",
    "80FFEF7E": "Of Ascendance. I would be their guide. They would learn these things from me. And in them, they would find truth and power.",
    "80FFEF80": "The Brays were here. How fine their avarice, how grand their hubris. Such great spirit echoes through time and space. It lives on long after any mortal form. Are they all gone? I wonder",
    "80FFEF82": "Those who worked here sought knowledge, despite dangers, heedless of consequences. Some seekers find reward. Others, ruin. Which shall you be?",
    "80FFEF84": "The study of alien flora concealed stranger sciences, but it was not without its own merit. They learned much here that has since been lost. ",
    "80FFEF86": "The pirates came in the wake of our Collapse to pick at our bones.",
    "80FFEF88": "I have no answers as to whether it was bravery or desperation that drove them to scavenge at the edge of the Hive's most hallowed ground.",
    "80FFEF8A": "But the Hellmouth has been rich in its bounty.",
    "80FFEF8C": "And many Fallen crews made a name among the old Houses for the treasures stolen from this dead rock.",
    "80FFEF8E": "How many crews have called this Ketch home? How many worlds has it plundered in the name of Fallen Houses that have since crumbled?",
    "80FFEF90": "Now the grand Houses, like this Ketch, are broken things—shades of old glory, like poor Luna.",
    "80FFEF92": "Once majestic, once an inspiration, now nothing more than a shattered relic of glory days beyond reclamation.",
    "80FFEF94": "It's unclear to me are the remaining Fallen less because they have shed the dead ways of Kells and Archons, or are they more?",
    "80FFEF96": "Is the shedding of their societal chains and the dissolution of their faith their end?",
    "80FFEF98": "Or an evolution? I fear the scattered Fallen of today are forebearers of a terrible threat yet to come.",
    "80FFEF9A": "The question I ponder when considering the Eliksni and their fractured society is how we, the supposed heroes we claim to be, react to a species on the brink?",
    "80FFEF9C": "As we are.",
    "80FFEF9E": "To my mind, we must be cruel. End them now, while they are on the brink, or risk whatever it is they will one day become.",
    "80FFEFA0": "The House of Dusk is not the future of the Fallen, but it is a sign of their evolution—of a future yet to come",
    "80FFEFA2": "No longer the desperate fools clinging to a lost history and misguided faith in machines. ",
    "80FFEFA4": "I am curious as to what the Eliksni will become on the far side of their current struggle.",
    "80FFEFA6": "Sai descended into these depths with an unequaled compassion for those around her. That's the type of thing that gets you killed.  ",
    "80FFEFA8": "If you ask me, Sai desired the respect of her fireteam. She died not realizing she had it all along.",
    "80FFEFAA": "Oh, Eriana—vengeful Eriana. Crota may have taken her Light, but she left her soul on the battlefield. ",
    "80FFEFAC": "She had a death wish long before she approached me. In the end, of course, she blamed me for what happened. Pride begets death.  ",
    "80FFEFAE": "If you'd asked me long ago what I thought of Eris Morn, you'd have learned kindness does not flow through my veins.",
    "80FFEFB0": "But I have since gained a reverence for Eris. I thought her broken. Foolish. But I was the fool. Eris was the best of us all and still is.",
    "80FFEFB2": "I entered the Hellmouth with a sense of fateful inevitability. We would all die, or worse. I knew this to be true.",
    "80FFEFB4": "Woefully unprepared was what we were. I stand by that. But it doesn't mean I didn't respect them. I did then, and I always will.",
    "80FFEFB6": "Few perils in the cosmos are as dangerous as an idea. And few ideas are as dangerous as the heretical notion festering in the Hellmouth.",
    "80FFEFB8": "Eris torments herself for her erstwhile fireteam and the fates we marched into together. An appreciated but needless penance.",
    "80FFEFBA": "Our struggle is a grand dialog. We exchange blood for understanding. It is not tragedy; it is simply the price, and ours to pay.",
    "80FFEFBC": "Deep below, the rudderless Hidden Swarm seek guidance. Order. They won't find it. Because of what you did—what you didn't do.",
    "80FFEFBE": "It should've been your hand guiding them in Oryx's stead. Yet you disrupted a glorious engine. You: the arrogant, anomalous variable. ",
    "80FFEFC0": "Deep below, the rudderless Hidden Swarm seek guidance. Purpose. What we destroyed, we did not replace—but the void will be filled all the same.",
    "80FFEFC2": "The Moon is fragile. Even more so now than before. Look no further than the oozing schisms brought forth by the Pyramid.",
    "80FFEFC4": "May they serve as a warning: The Moon has been carved out, far beyond imagination. Fetid miasma rises. It belongs to the Hive now.",
    "80FFEFC6": "In a nest left untouched, the Hive pulse beneath the surface of the Moon. Their influence grows. Their presence spreads.",
    "80FFEFC8": "What you see rising from the schisms is the very essence of the Hive themselves. For there is naught else within the Moon's core.",
    "80FFEFCA": "The fissures appeared when the Pyramid stirred. They quake and belch, setting loose the potent energies that have long simmered just below.",
    "80FFEFCC": "Should they be allowed to continue, the Hidden Swarm will make further outgambles to the surface. This is but a taste of the change to come.",
    "80FFEFCE": "New voices reverberate through the lunar formicary. Heresies whispered in the dark. ",
    "80FFEFD0": "Below your feet, the Hidden Swarm are acquainting themselves with deeper magics beyond their reckoning. To say nothing of ours.",
    "80FFEFD2": "Behold: causation in all its exquisite majesty. Your persistence reshapes the Hidden Swarm; in turn, the Swarm reshapes the Moon. ",
    "80FFEFD4": "Their adaptations will only become more profound, the effects more pronounced. They have you to thank for this. ",
    "80FFEFD6": "From this pit, despair rose to power. Crota climbed out, and we all paid the price for not immediately noticing.",
    "80FFEFD8": "We blame him for what happened, refusing to take responsibility for our own ignorance. ",
    "80FFEFDA": "Knowledge was our only true path to power, and we chose guns blazing instead.",
    "80FFEFDC": "Omar Agah entered these depths with his own unique faults: disbelief and distrust. But beneath it all was his truth: fear.",
    "80FFEFDE": "The Hive fed off this very fear. Poor Eris had to watch as his Light was stripped from his soul and his essence used to strengthen the Hive.",
    "80FFEFE0": "The Hellmouth: the foundary of Crota's deepest dreams.",
    "80FFEFE2": "Fools look at the Hive and see mindlessness. But they bear deep wounds—and they do not forget those who wounded them.",
    "80FFEFE4": "Crota. Oryx. Omnigul. Each death shook the Hellmouth to the deepest pit. But as we say: That which doesn't kill you, et cetera.",
    "80FFEFE6": "Just ask Hashladûn. Or her slaughtered sisters.",
    "80FFEFE8": "Crota claimed innumerable souls in this pit. The wages of our heroism were countless corpses and a strengthened, emboldened enemy.",
    "80FFEFEA": "It's no wonder the Hidden Swarm see Guardians as their great whetstone: ever eager and willing to sharpen their blade.",
    "80FFEFEC": "This place reeks of death. This could be said of any structure on the Moon, but this hall is especially saturated.",
    "80FFEFEE": "You yourself carry painful memories of this place. Discard them. Their only use is to weigh you down—and to empower your enemy.",
    "80FFEFF0": "Don't let the past weigh you down. All that has been is merely the bridge to what is.",
    "80FFEFF2": "I wish Eris could see it this way. But she is bound irretrievably to her pain. ",
    "80FFEFF4": "The origin of many Nightmares can be traced to this exact location. Here the Hive bred fear itself, enduring and true.",
    "80FFEFF6": "Slay as many abominations as you like; the impressions they leave upon you will remain. We carry every fallen foe with us. Always.",
    "80FFEFF8": "The Hive know no limits when it comes to ambition. Nothing remains sacred within the darkness of their ritual halls.",
    "80FFEFFA": "In the summoning pits, that was truer than ever. A horrifying abomination—Phogoth, the Untamed—was created within. ",
    "80FFEFFC": "A series of unfortunate Guardians met their end under the weight of Phogoth's might.  ",
    "80FFEFFE": "He strew them across the battlefields of the Moon and, together with Crota's brood, gave the Great Disaster its name.",
    "80FFF000": "Not even Crota's brood could fully contain the rage of Phogoth, the Untamed. His power was nearly unmatched.",
    "80FFF002": "But in the end, the Light overpowered Phogoth, and he was slain by your hand.",
    "80FFF004": "But in the end, the Light overpowered Phogoth, and he was slain at the will of Guardians just like yourself.",
    "80FFF006": "Countless Guardians perished not just on the battlefields of the Great Disaster, but within the lair of the Hive as well.",
    "80FFF008": "Having lured them in, the Hive had a plan. It was domination and death. For Guardians, there was no escape that day. ",
    "80FFF00A": "You feel it, don't you? The hunger that cannot be sated. What's next? What if? Why? It eats at us, what we don't know.",
    "80FFF00C": "It always has. Ignorance has never been bliss—not once you've learned you lack the truth.",
    "80FFF00E": "Tragic. Casting a line out into the ocean of space, ignorant of what swims out there, waiting in the depths.",
    "80FFF010": "If they had known the truth, even the barest inkling, they would have shrunk away from its shores in terror.",
    "80FFF012": "Before we could leap from planet to planet like fleas, we had to crawl through the void like worms.",
    "80FFF014": "The Accelerator flew humanity's necessities on swift wings, flitting them from the Moon to the colonies like starlings.",
    "80FFF016": "But worms do not survive flights with birds.",
    "80FFF018": "Just think of the old colony ships, lumbering toward some distant planet loaded with bodies.",
    "80FFF01A": "And then some soulless cargo package flashes by, shot from this Accelerator and piloted by an AI. It weighs you down, life.",
    "80FFF01C": "All great journeys begin with a single step, but not if you stand at the precipice. ",
    "80FFF01E": "How does one tell the difference between the horizon and an abyss in a place like this? They couldn't. Are you certain you can?",
    "80FFF020": "Dark the Moon. Dark the night. Hush the station. Hush the Hive. Gone their leaders. Gone the Light.",
    "80FFF022": "They told others their mission was exobotany, but this fig leaf could not hide their desire. They wanted knowledge the Traveler would not give them. Nothing is sweeter than forbidden fruit.",
    "80FFF024": "So many wonders of the age, so many sciences still used, conceived of here, in silence and secrecy. What inspired them? What did they find in this desolation?",
    "80FFF026": "Serenity. Tranquility. Fertility. It seems a fine place for investigating alien life. Yes, but what of Storms? What of Cold? What of Crises? When does a sanctuary become a prison?",
    "80FFF028": "In the Hive, the Vanguard faced a new threat they didn't understand. So they did what they do best—they shot at it.",
    "80FFF02A": "And to their detriment, it shot back. Death was delivered the day of our Great Disaster.",
    "80FFF02C": "Arrogance is little more than a by-product of hubris. And hubris destroys most of us in the end.",
    "80FFF02E": "Hundreds of Guardian souls shattered against the edges of Crota's blade the day of the Great Disaster, their Light consumed by his ambition.",
    "80FFF030": "Hubris blinded us to the realities of this place. To the hidden power pulsating throughout. One many shades darker than the Hive.",
    "80FFF032": "Crota sat at the forefront of our story, and so we turned a blind eye to the very idea of puppet masters in the shadows. Darkness incarnate. ",
    "80FFF034": "Exploration and discovery are pleasant but thin euphemisms for conquest. This was as true in our history as in any you'll find.",
    "80FFF036": "Our first steps into the inky dark were no different. Lest we forget: The Hive's lunar settlements predate our own.",
    "80FFF038": "Had the Traveler not come to our fragile home, humanity would've carried on as it always had. Reaching blindly in the dark.",
    "80FFF03A": "We likely would've extinguished ourselves well before the Hive took up the task. So I ask: Are we fortunate? Or unfortunate?",
    "80FFF03C": "We were destined to be found by this ageless expression: the pursuit of a last true shape. If not the Hive, some other adherent.",
    "80FFF03E": "Slay every living disciple of sword logic, but the logic itself—as any hard-coded feature of the cosmos—will simply await rediscovery.",
    "80FFF040": "How long were the Hive on the Moon? How did they arrive? How patient they were, listening to invaders scrabble across its surface. But I do not think they were hiding. They awaited a sign.",
    "80FFF042": "For millennia, humanity gazed at the Moon and envisioned visiting it. Yet, no one dreamed it a trespass. The Hive is not a welcoming host, as you well know.",
    "80FFF044": "Come, slayer of Oryx. I have words for you. ",
    "80FFF046": "Come, opener of vacancies. ",
    "80FFF048": "Greetings, pawn of the Queen. ",

    "80FFF052": "Listen, listen",
    "80FFF054": "Will you be prepared? Or will you be boring?",
    "80FFF056": "For eons, the Pyramid sat hidden beneath the surface. The Hive, however, knew of its presence. For how long, I do not know.",
    "80FFF058": "Their lust for power kept it secret. That we know of it now only makes me question whether it's due to coincidence or design.",
    "80FFF05A": "I could tell you that the Pyramid hid from me as it did from you. But I would be betraying the truth.",
    "80FFF05C": "In this form, sight extends beyond the borders of certain realities.",

    "80FFF062": "But you have. It's always you, isn't it? ",
    "80FFF064": "Leaderless, the Hidden Swarm have sought a replacement. Sword logic dictates the violent removal of oneself in favor of the powerful.",
    "80FFF066": "Never underestimate the machinations of the Hive. In the absence of guidance, they are always in search of it.",
    "80FFF068": "One wonders the effects of the Pyramid on the Hive. If they've existed in its shadow for so long, have they ever communed with it?",
    "80FFF06A": "Eris was the first to bring the Pyramid to life Was it of her will? Or the Pyramid's?",
    "80FFF06C": "The Hive must hate her for it after trying for so long to do the same and failing.",
    "80FFF06E": "Or perhaps it's relief they feel. After so much time, they can finally pursue its power, whether it wants them to or not.",
    "80FFF070": "Cloistered in their Keep, the daughters of Crota labor to architect a future renewed for their Swarm.",
    "80FFF072": "They refuse to accept a world in which Oryx was struck down but not succeeded. They seek to correct that which you left undone.",

    "80FFF076": "When Oryx fell, Crota's brood rallied around the strongest of his children, reaffirming their faith in the logic, accepting their loss.",
    "80FFF078": "But deep in the hearts of four of Crota's daughters—Besurith, Kinox, Hashladûn, and Voshyr—a seed of doubt quietly took root.",
    "80FFF07A": "They resolved to lead their leaderless Swarm toward a new dawn and slaughter all who stood in their way. ",
    "80FFF07C": "Does it burden you, Guardian, to know that your presence here was not simply expected, but desired? That you were summoned?",
    "80FFF07E": "It is no mere coincidence that you, the slayer of Oryx, have been drawn to this place.",
    "80FFF080": "It is no mere coincidence that you, the slayer of Ghaul, have been drawn to this place. ",
    "80FFF082": "The Pyramid can't conjure Nightmares from Hive minds. They require a human psyche—anguished, burdened, Lightbearing vessels.",
    "80FFF084": "The heresy was born here, in the Keep, where the daughters of Crota first began their experiments with Nightmares.",
    "80FFF086": "It was here their priestess asked the question that her sisters would not: If Oryx cannot be resurrected, can he be remade?",
    "80FFF088": "The Hidden Swarm's abberant behavior sprung from a simple conjecture: What if Oryx was meant to die, so that he might be reborn?",
    "80FFF08A": "Ludicrous, teleological thinking. An affront to everything he held dear. Unfortunately, Oryx is not here to correct them.",
    "80FFF08C": "Sword logic demands that which dies remain dead. Hobbled and wounded by the loss of their leaders, the Hidden Swarm no longer agree.",
    "80FFF08E": "They've unmoored themselves from the foundational tenets of the logic. Until this affliction is snuffed out, it will only spread.",
    "80FFF090": "The Pyramid hasn't always held residence on the Moon. Like anything foreign, it arrived here somehow.",
    "80FFF092": "That chasm would suggest a fall and a crash. And it is as such. Only a single question lingers: Why? The collapse largely remains a mystery.",
    "80FFF094": "The Hive and their rituals. Like moths to a flame, they know no other way. They try time and again to revive the souls of the dead.",
    "80FFF096": "Or even to bring forth something new. An abomination. A god. And now, our very own Nightmares.",
    "80FFF098": "In the absence of the ability to bring Nightmares forth, the Hive manipulate ours, worshipping and even dying for them.",
    "80FFF09A": "No doubt they have plans for the Nightmares. The Hive adapt. They evolve. And they do it quickly.",
    "80FFF09C": "The Moon sits lush with schisms. The result of Eris's curiosity. A Pyramid of pure power with the ability to terraform.",
    "80FFF09E": "Sounds familiar, doesn't it? If the Traveler is a god of Light, then what does that make the Pyramid who spews our tragedies back at us? ",
    "80FFF0A0": "We must always question the unknowable, for that is the only path to knowing.",
    "80FFF0A2": "There is much history in the dust here. Grasp a handful and you will hold Light now extinguished. You will hold power misguided.",
    "80FFF0A4": "These grounds are covered in the madness of days gone by. Of Guardians and Hive alike. History haunts this place.",
    "80FFF0A6": "All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate,",
    "80FFF0A8": "And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome?",
    "80FFF0AA": "I have decided to impart upon you some of my knowledge. Listen well.",
    "80FFF0AC": "Sharpen yourself with knowledge before the true battle begins. ",
    "80FFF0AE": "Words are weapons, thoughts the art of wielding them. Listen well. ",
    "80FFF0B0": "I will teach you what I know. Executions are so much more fun when the martyr thinks they have a chance against the lion. ",
    "80FFF0B2": "Let me teach you. The coming clash will be so much more entertaining if you are prepared for it. ",
    "80FFF0B4": "There is something you must see. Carry your thinking-machine to the place I send you. ",
    "80FFF0B6": "Go where I send you. I have knowledge for you. ",
    "80FFF0B9": "Fallen are ruthless fight like they have nothing left to lose",
    "80FFF0BD": "Where is it? Is it stealthed?",
    "80FFF0BF": "These damn pirates they know our worlds better than we do now",
    "80FFF0C1": "Uncloak yourself and face me, you four-armed coward!",
    "80FFF0C3": "Think it's Fallen. Can't be sure. Sticks to the shadows. ",
    "80FFF0C5": "Can't get a bead on it—keeps teleporting around—",
    "80FFF0C7": "She's already killed me ten times she's playing with me",
    "80FFF0C9": "If she gets me death will be a blessing",
    "80FFF0CB": "Whatever it is, it's coming from the Moon!",
    "80FFF0CD": "If she gets me don't rez me again. Just let it be.",
    "80FFF0CF": "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But if the Wizard gets you ",
    "80FFF0D1": "I can't get its screams out of my head ",
    "80FFF0D3": "When it roars, I swear the whole Moon shakes",
    "80FFF0D5": "Which is it? Phogoth? Or some new abomination?",
    "80FFF0D7": "Broke free of the Summoning Pits. Not even the Hive can control it",
    "80FFF0D9": "It's hungry so hungry. ",
    "80FFF0DB": "It was born of suffering and now it wishes to inflict its pain upon its prey. ",
    "80FFF0DD": "The Fallen defend it to the death. I can't get close",
    "80FFF0DF": "This is no mere machine a machine could not hunt us so ruthlessly. ",
    "80FFF0E1": "Not a Prime but just as deadly ",
    "80FFF0E3": "It knows things about us. How we fight, what we want.",
    "80FFF0E5": "Damned machine sick, rusting parody of our Traveler",
    "80FFF0E7": "[sigh] Risen by the Traveler, laid low by its twisted shadow",

    "80FFF0EB": "It's right behind me I can feel it.",

    "80FFF0FA": "All Guardians in this sector: We're seeing a Fallen arsenal Ketch bound for your location. Give them a warm welcome.",
    "80FFF0FC": "We've just scanned a Fallen Ketch inbound to your location. It's carrying Walkers and other arms. You know what to do, Guardian.",
    "80FFF0FE": "Fallen arsenal Ketch detected. It's en route to your sector. Crush them.",
    "80FFF100": "The Fallen are bringing in an arms shipment. Any Guardians nearby: Rally to the landing zone and destroy whatever comes out of that Ketch. ",

    "80FFF154": "What is it I can do?",
    "80FFF156": "What have you come to learn?",
    "80FFF158": "You've grown strong, Guardian. Perhaps strong enough to face what comes next.",
    "80FFF15A": "I can sense you have faced great challenges. Good. You will need to be at your best for the Darkness to come.",
    "80FFF15C": "You have survived the pits. Say what you will.",
    "80FFF15E": "The Moon still crawls, doesn't it Guardian?",
    "80FFF160": "Don't look at me!",
    "80FFF162": "No time to rest now!",
    "80FFF164": "Speak quickly, then return to your search.",
    "80FFF166": "What is it? What do you see?",
    "80FFF168": "What is it? Another vision?",
    "80FFF16A": "Speak your truth. I will always listen to you. ",
    "80FFF16C": "Does the Void whisper to you? I can help you discern its message.",
    "80FFF16E": "I know you are still there. I may be blind, but I can hear you. ",
    "80FFF170": "Speak now, while you have the chance. No regrets. ",
    "80FFF172": "Vision-keeper. Speak with me.",
    "80FFF174": "Whatever it is, you can tell me. I will listen. ",
    "80FFF176": "Do not keep silent. That way lies regret. ",

    "80FFF17A": "The mark of the Hellmouth is fresh upon you. Speak.",
    "80FFF17C": "I regret I did not bid you farewell before I left the City. I convinced myself you would not miss me. I know better now. ",
    "80FFF17E": "The Taken King should not have been so bold. The tomb of Saturn will hold him for all time.",
    "80FFF180": "The Hive are still dangerous. Pray we do not have to relearn old lessons again.",
    "80FFF182": "Once again, you have proven yourself. Interesting.",
    "80FFF184": "The system may never be free of the stain Oryx left behind.",
    "80FFF186": "One day that thing must be pulled from the sky above Saturn. One day, it must burn.",
    "80FFF188": "The Dreadnaught lurks like a tumor, a dark stain on the soul of our system.",
    "80FFF18A": "While the Taken King lived, his fell voice echoed in my mind. Others thought I was mad, hearing voices. Sometimes I thought the same.",
    "80FFF18C": "But after Oryx's true death the voices went quiet. Now I only hear them if I seek them out.",
    "80FFF18E": "The Speaker is gone. And who mourns his absence? No one now. No one ever. ",
    "80FFF190": "The Tower was a monument to lies, a false security that sapped the hope from all who stood upon it.",
    "80FFF192": "You have walked in Eleusinia. The throne world built for Light, that Mara Sov created to thwart Oryx. I was honored to offer what help I could. ",
    "80FFF194": "I've met this Variks. He is hiding much more than Petra thinks.",
    "80FFF196": "Do they still speak of Mara Sov so fondly beyond the Outpost?",
    "80FFF198": "Out in the Reef, the voices grow louder. Too many, too loud.",
    "80FFF19A": "I'm familiar with the Reef, Guardian. What did you see?",
    "80FFF19C": "One day the Reef shall rise again, greater than it has ever been.",
    "80FFF19E": "The Reefborn could be powerful allies in the fight against the Darkness. If we let them be.",
    "80FFF1A0": "All we can do to support Petra and her people, we should do.",
    "80FFF1A2": "I cannot stop. There is no time for rest. I can survive this. I have survived worse. ",
    "80FFF1A4": "When Crota was slain, I thought that would be the end. It will never end.",
    "80FFF1A6": "If I can hear the words of the dead am I dead as well?",
    "80FFF1A8": "The words of the dead hunter, the whispers of Cayde, fill my thoughts.",
    "80FFF1AA": "Would you kindly tell Ikora that I am not in danger? Her mothering is very distracting.",
    "80FFF1AC": "The quiet here is deafening. It is full of that which is unsaid.",
    "80FFF1AE": "I cannot leave the past behind. I do not want to. ",
    "80FFF1B0": "We cannot unsee what we have seen. We can only prevent others from seeing it. ",
    "80FFF1B2": "Since losing my Human sight, my other senses have grown—particularly touch.",
    "80FFF1B4": "When I feel the weight and texture of a bead or token, I feel reassured.",
    "80FFF1B6": "The beads and charms have no inherent power. It is the act of creating them that brings comfort. ",
    "80FFF1B8": "This time, we have advance warning. Room to prepare. We must use it. ",
    "80FFF1BA": "Toland found me in the darkness, taught me what I needed to know. And vanished. I know he yet lives.",
    "80FFF1BC": "Here, the nature of the dark can be contemplated. Here, it can be understood.",
    "80FFF1BE": "The Guardians are at war, again. As it was in the days of old, as it was in the Great Disaster.",
    "80FFF1C0": "Yes, Cayde, you are dead. But I can still hear your voice.",
    "80FFF1C2": "I do not think I will return to the City, even when this is over. There is so much more to life than being safe.",
    "80FFF1C4": "Our future histories will speak of this war as a turning point, Guardian. They will mark these days as the end of one age. And the beginning of another.",
    "80FFF1C6": "I knew Andal Brask, did I ever tell you? The Vanguard's Hunter before Cayde. He taught me much. But my time in the darkness of the Hellmouth taught me so much more.",
    "80FFF1C8": "Zavala does not trust me. He does not have to. As long as he listens, that is all I require.",
    "80FFF1CA": "The Crucible holds little interest for me. No training ground can prepare you for what waits in the shadows.",
    "80FFF1CC": "Have you spent enough time training with Shaxx? Real Darkness stands against us today.",
    "80FFF1CE": "Do you trust in your fireteam, Guardian? Are you willing to sacrifice yourself for their lives? Can you trust your Light to them? ",
    "80FFF1D0": "What has the Vanguard tasked you to do? Will it ready you for battle with true Darkness?",
    "80FFF1D2": "The Gensym scribes have many theories. The Hidden have facts.",
    "80FFF1D4": "You have proven yourself quite capable, Guardian. Perhaps you are ready.",
    "80FFF1D6": "This was but one simple challenge, Guardian. You will be tested again. And again.",
    "80FFF1D8": "Hear me, Guardian. One day, I shall return to the Hellmouth. And on that day, the Hive will finally know fear.",
    "80FFF1DA": "Eriana was sure we could retake the Moon. And paid with her life. One day, the scales will be balanced.",
    "80FFF1DC": "Time does not cast shadows as we understand them. But they can be seen just the same.",
    "80FFF1DE": "The darkness within the Moon suffers more quietly now. Good.",
    "80FFF1E0": "I understand now. This Festival of the Lost doesn't celebrate death it celebrates what was lost to death. I still don't understand the candy. ",
    "80FFF1E2": "In the Pit I subsided on lichen and ice. When finally I reached the surface, I broke into a Golden Age locker, found preserved rations.",
    "80FFF1E4": "Those raisins were the sweetest food I had ever tasted.",
    "80FFF1E6": "Go. Enjoy your candies and lanterns. And as the sugar melts in your mouth, reflect on this: Nothing lasts. Nothing lasts. ",
    "80FFF1E8": "Is it the Dawning already? Perhaps I shall use this occasion to apply pressure on Asher again. He owes me an analysis of the Vex Mind Quria. ",
    "80FFF1EA": "Please give Eva Levante my best. She is a most tenacious woman. If she used her powers for good instead of frivolity, I would even admire her. ",
    "80FFF1EC": "Your armor is impressive, Titan. Wei Ning and Vell Tarlowe wore armor such as this as well. In the end, it was not enough to stand against the fury of the Hive.",
    "80FFF1EE": "Ask Ikora of the Hidden one day, Warlock. You may be surprised what she says.",
    "80FFF1F0": "Cayde and I agreed on one thing, at least: a Hunter's place is not behind walls. We are not Titans. You and I belong out here, where we may touch the wilds.",
    "80FFF1F2": "Welcome, Titan. I heard your approach. ",
    "80FFF1F4": "Loud footsteps. Welcome, Titan. ",
    "80FFF1F6": "A Hunter is near. I didn't hear you approach. ",
    "80FFF1F8": "Well done, Hunter. You almost surprised me.",
    "80FFF1FA": "I sense your thoughts, Warlock.",
    "80FFF1FC": "Welcome, Warlock. Your thoughts are loud.",
    "80FFF1FE": "Come forward.",
    "80FFF200": "I'm glad to see you safe. ",
    "80FFF202": "Yes?",
    "80FFF204": "You have returned. ",
    "80FFF206": "What have you seen?",
    "80FFF208": "I sensed your approach. ",
    "80FFF20A": "I'm relieved to see you. ",
    "80FFF20C": "What brings you all this way, Guardian?",
    "80FFF20E": "I bide my time. Why are you here?",
    "80FFF210": "My mind floats free on a sea of Ash and Bone. Approach, Guardian.",
    "80FFF212": "Is there a reason we should speak?",
    "80FFF214": "You are in danger, here. Do not wait to speak.",
    "80FFF216": "Shadows surround us, Guardian. Speak.",
    "80FFF218": "Did Zavala send you? He does not trust me.",
    "80FFF21A": "Did Ikora send you? She worries, always.",
    "80FFF21C": "I do not wish the frustration of these vile phantoms on anybody.",
    "80FFF21E": "You have traveled through Darkness to speak with me.",
    "80FFF220": "I do not claim to know all. But I will tell you what I can.",
    "80FFF222": "Your words are for my ears, Guardian. Use them.",
    "80FFF224": "There is war on the air, Guardian. Speak quickly.",
    "80FFF226": "This is not the Tower, Guardian. Do not stand idle.",
    "80FFF228": "Has another year passed already? ",
    "80FFF22A": "In the pit, each year was a century. Now, the years fly by faster than I can track.",
    "80FFF22C": "I do not understand Crimson Days. You make a commitment to a fellow Guardian and then that commitment ends? ",
    "80FFF22E": "Do not take a Crimson Double unless you are willing to give your life, your Light, your very self, to keep them safe. ",
    "80FFF230": "In times of crisis Eriana was a soothing voice. If only she were still with us.",
    "80FFF232": "Eriana-3 was strongest, and the leader of our band. I miss her most of all.",
    "80FFF234": "In my nightmares I see him still. I wonder if the Light of Omar Agah still feeds the Hive spawn.",
    "80FFF236": "I tried, Omar I tried!",
    "80FFF238": "Wicked phantoms! Banish yourselves.",
    "80FFF23A": "They are all incessant, no matter the length to which I ignore.",
    "80FFF23C": "The Pyramid seeks to trick me with Toland's phantom, but he is not deceased.",
    "80FFF23E": "The real Toland scours the length of many dimensions.",
    "80FFF240": "Toland has found himself amongst the chaos of Luna. He always did put curiosity of the unknown above all else.",
    "80FFF242": "Toland's fate was unfortunate, but of his own making.",
    "80FFF244": "Oh, how I wish there was an end to the constant bickering of these phantoms.",
    "80FFF246": "They aren't real I shouldn't feel this way anymore. ",
    "80FFF248": "Vell I failed you.",
    "80FFF24A": "This is madness. Vell Tarlowe does not deserve this false remembrance.",
    "80FFF24C": "The Pyramid seeks to build a sinister momentum with these phantoms.",
    "80FFF24E": "These phantoms are simply a distraction to ignore.",
    "80FFF250": "The Pyramid sits in silence, but with so much to say.",
    "80FFF252": "That is not Sai Mota. I will not give in to the Pyramid's tricks.",
    "80FFF254": "How dare this evil Pyramid conjure visages of my deceased friends. I must let their memory rest.",
    "80FFF256": "Sai you deserved better.",
    "80FFF258": "It gets better. You get used to the pain.",
    "80FFF25A": "No one else can do what must be done.",

    "80FFF26C": "With its dying breath, the Traveler created Ghosts to open doors.",
    "80FFF26E": "The City sleeps the Hive do not. ",
    "80FFF270": "They took my Light I took their eyes.",
    "80FFF272": "The City's walls are not shelter; they are a mask to cover our fear.",
    "80FFF274": "In the end, I spent more years with the Hive than with the Guardians I fought beside.",
    "80FFF276": "Tell me your news.",
    "80FFF278": "Speak. ",
    "80FFF27A": "Hold nothing back. ",

    "80FFF282": "I know you have questions, Guardian. Speak them to me.",
    "80FFF284": "The Darkness presses. Speak.",
    "80FFF286": "You have not given in to the hate of dead Kings.",
    "80FFF288": "Speak, if you are able. ",
    "80FFF28A": "Say what you have to say. No regrets. ",
    "80FFF28C": "What evils befell you?",

    "80FFF292": "Step lightly, Titan. Your tread draws attention.",
    "80FFF294": "I am here, Titan. I will stand with you.",
    "80FFF296": "Victory invites defeat, Titan. You know this.",
    "80FFF298": "You yearn to learn more, Warlock. As I do.",
    "80FFF29A": "Do you feel it, Warlock? Echoes of the Traveler's pain.",
    "80FFF29C": "Mind the spells here, Warlock. Your power is great.",
    "80FFF29E": "The truth is here, Warlock, right in front of you. You must see it.",

    "80FFF2B8": "Let us begin. ",
    "80FFF2BA": "Greetings.",
    "80FFF2BC": "Truth in action. ",
    "80FFF2BE": "I can smell the hatred of the Hive upon you.",
    "80FFF2C0": "Welcome, my friend. ",
    "80FFF2C2": "The corruption of the worm clings to your boot.",
    "80FFF2C4": "You have faced the Hellmouth and lived.",
    "80FFF2C6": "We must speak again of the Hive.",
    "80FFF2C8": "The Hellmouth speaks. You must answer.",
    "80FFF2CA": "King-slayer. ",
    "80FFF2CC": "God-killer. ",

    "80FFF2FC": "That should be of use.",
    "80FFF2FE": "I do think that will help.",
    "80FFF300": "Use it carefully, Guardian.",
    "80FFF302": "I think you have chosen well.",
    "80FFF304": "I entrust it to you. ",
    "80FFF306": "This is precious to me. Use it well. ",
    "80FFF308": "Few could handle this. ",
    "80FFF30A": "I can think of no one better to have this. ",
    "80FFF30C": "Use it in my name. ",
    "80FFF30E": "A high price was paid in its creation.",
    "80FFF310": "That will hold against the Darkness.",
    "80FFF312": "Interesting that you chose that. Very interesting.",
    "80FFF314": "Shadows still cling to it in my sight. Be wary.",
    "80FFF316": "Do not let it fade or wear, Guardian.",
    "80FFF318": "If you are sure it will help, use it well.",
    "80FFF31A": "That was not easily acquired.",
    "80FFF31C": "So much death surrounds it.",
    "80FFF31E": "I do not know what it will do when the lights are out. Stand wary.",
    "80FFF320": "Did you choose that? Or did it choose you?",
    "80FFF322": "Do not listen when it whispers.",
    "80FFF324": "Farewell.",
    "80FFF326": "Stay alive. ",
    "80FFF328": "Go, and see this through.",
    "80FFF32A": "Destroy those that would worship the Darkness.",
    "80FFF32C": "Until we speak again.",
    "80FFF32E": "Be careful. We cannot lose you. ",
    "80FFF330": "Push back the darkness here, Guardian. Make a stand.",
    "80FFF332": "Go well, Guardian.",
    "80FFF334": "Stay to the Light.",
    "80FFF336": "Stay out of the shadows.",
    "80FFF338": "Watch where you step on the path.",
    "80FFF33A": "Don't die.",
    "80FFF33C": "Truth in action. ",
    "80FFF33E": "…Alone again. ",
    "80FFF340": "Go swiftly, and see it done.",
    "80FFF342": "Many things hinge upon your actions, Guardian.",
    "80FFF344": "Don't die. ",
    "80FFF346": "Truth in action. ",
    "80FFF348": "To your safe return. ",
    "80FFF34A": "Go, and burn the darkness from that grave.",
    "80FFF34C": "I am sure you will impress me.",
    "80FFF34E": "This will challenge you, Guardian. Embrace it.",
    "80FFF350": "Your Light is a gift and a weapon. Remember that.",
    "80FFF352": "Face the darkness of Luna with strength, Guardian.",
    "80FFF354": "I have learned to honor each parting as if it were the last. ",
    "80FFF356": "If you must die die well. ",
    "80FFF358": "Relish the hunt.",
    "80FFF35A": "May your blades be sharp. ",
    "80FFF4E4": "Eris. We found Vell Tarlowe's mark. ",
    "80FFF4E8": "I can't believe it. Vell",
    "80FFF4EA": "He forged a link for every life he rescued. ",
    "80FFF4EC": "One of these is for me. ",
    "80FFF4EE": "Thank you for bringing this back. ",
    "80FFF4F0": "I know this isn't really Eriana. She herself said she didn't want to be remembered this way. ",
    "80FFF4F2": "I want to remember her the way she was. Before the Disaster. Before the darkness. ",
    "80FFF4F4": "They have no worms how do they commune with the Darkness? ",
    "80FFF4F6": "Do not mock me. Toland is not the only one capable of understanding the enemy!",
    "80FFF4F8": "No. No, Vell, not again",
    "80FFF4FA": "I did not want to ask Vell to join our fireteam—I knew he would say yes. ",
    "80FFF4FC": "But he found out and volunteered. ",
    "80FFF4FE": "As a Pilgrim Guard, Vell had experience leading refugees through enemy territory. Fighting only the battles he had to fight. ",
    "80FFF500": "He was subtle for a Titan. ",
    "80FFF502": "Perhaps too subtle, when it mattered. ",
    "80FFF504": "I want to remember",
    "80FFF506": "Omar offered to make me a talisman before we descended. ",
    "80FFF508": "I was young and foolish then and thought I knew better than to believe in superstition. ",
    "80FFF50A": "I am glad he did not listen to me.",
    "80FFF50C": "There was a moment, in the Pit, where I perhaps could have saved Omar. ",
    "80FFF50E": "Or perhaps we both would have perished. I will never know.",
    "80FFF510": "I tried to save you I tried to save you",
    "80FFF512": "Please! Leave me alone",
    "80FFF514": "No wait! ",
    "80FFF516": "Don't leave. I don't I need you.",
    "80FFF518": "Eris, we found something that we believe should be yours.",
    "80FFF51A": "It's Sai's necklace. I'd recognize her craftsmanship anywhere. ",
    "80FFF51C": "She's the one that taught me how to use a knife to carve beads. ",
    "80FFF51E": "Perhaps I will take up carving again",
    "80FFF520": "Thank you.",
    "80FFF522": "Eris, when your strike team headed to the moon—did Eriana-3 carry the letters Wei Ning sent her?",
    "80FFF524": "Yes to remind her of why we fought. Why we sought to bring about Crota's end. ",
    "80FFF526": "It was not simply vengeance. Eriana wanted no one to suffer like she and Wei had suffered. ",
    "80FFF528": "That is how she should be remembered.",
    "80FFF52A": "[sigh]",
    "80FFF52C": "Sai spoke little—except when giving toasts. Then none could silence her.",
    "80FFF52E": "When she joined the fireteam, Sai asked for only one thing: to be avenged. ",
    "80FFF530": "I wasn't able to do that for her",
    "80FFF532": "But you did. When you slew Omnigul, Sai the real Sai, not this phantom was at peace. ",
    "80FFF534": "But I helped another Guardian to slay Omnigul. I think Sai—the real Sai, not this phantom—was at peace.",
    "80FFF536": "That is one of Toland's lost journals I have never laid eyes upon it",
    "80FFF538": "He knew. He knew about this Pyramid. He must have. And said nothing.",
    "80FFF53A": "Thank you for being here. For going where I couldn't.",
    "80FFF53C": "Eris, do you recognize this talisman?",
    "80FFF53E": "Omar surely made this, though I have never seen it before. ",
    "80FFF540": "Perhaps he made it in captivity hoping for rescue",
    "80FFF542": "No, that's not it. He knew his Light was lost. This talisman was not for him He meant for me to find it.",
    "80FFF544": "Thank you, friend, for one last gift of luck. ",
    "80FFF546": "I should not miss Toland. His ruthless pursuit of knowledge led to his downfall. ",
    "80FFF548": "He is not even gone. His spirit lingers, buoyed by the Ascendant Plane. ",
    "80FFF54A": "And yet a fireteam's bonds are not so easily undone. ",
    "80FFF54C": "Toland. His spirit came to visit me here, on the Moon. He told me you saw him in the Dreaming City.",
    "80FFF54E": "You have not visited the Dreaming City, have you? Toland wanders there as well.",
    "80FFF550": "His curiosity makes him predictable. I knew he could not resist a marvel like the Queen's Eleusinia. ",
    "80FFF552": "Ever since our descent into the Pit, when I thought upon my friends, I remembered only pain. ",
    "80FFF554": "These keepsakes have reminded me there was joy, too. ",
    "80FFF556": "So long as these treasures are here to remind me of my friends, these phantoms cannot hurt me.",
    "80FFF558": "I tried to save him I tried to save him ",
    "80FFF55A": "That is not Omar ",
    "80FFF55C": "Forgive me",
    "80FFF5A9": "Eris. We've reached the center of the Keep. Hashladûn's gone up the tower.",
    "80FFF5AD": "She has nowhere left to run. Resume the hunt. You must not hesitate nor relent.",
    "80FFF5AF": "Here she comes!",
    "80FFF5B1": "Do you feel it as I do, Guardian? A hatred as pure and potent as sunshine, soaking through your skin?",
    "80FFF5B3": "Hashladûn knows what you are. What you've done. She watched you cut through Crota, Oryx, Omnigul.",
    "80FFF5B5": "Hashladun knows what the Guardians have done. She watched as her lineage fell, one after the other—Crota, Oryx, Omnigul.",
    "80FFF5B7": "And she is eager to return that pain.",
    "80FFF5B9": "Your deeds have inspired an abiding fear and hatred in the Hive. But now there's something more.",
    "80FFF5BB": "You've been to where they long to go. Communed with the very object of their worship. ",
    "80FFF5BD": "Beneath the hatred lies a dreadful awe. Lower still: gnashing, searing envy. ",
    "80FFF5BF": "Though they've stumbled in the wake of Oryx's death, the Hive do not despair.",
    "80FFF5C1": "The advent of new leadership was all but assured. Such is the nature of their bitter logic: endless succession.",
    "80FFF5C3": "We may one day eradicate the Hive. The singular notion that drives them, however, is not so easily extinguished. ",
    "80FFF5C5": "Hashladûn is neither the strongest nor the most clever of Crota's progeny.",
    "80FFF5C7": "It was her ceaseless devotion to her sires that earned her station. Her viciousness.",
    "80FFF5C9": "Even in the chaos following Oryx's death, her faith was unquenchable. She led a ruthless inquisition of her scattered sisterhood.",
    "80FFF5CB": "The faithless were quartered and consumed. Fear renewed the conviction of those who survived.",
    "80FFF5CD": "That door won't budge until all the plates are activated.",
    "80FFF5CF": "The target's getting away. Let's activate those plates!",
    "80FFF5D1": "Potent energies are radiating from the Scarlet Keep and its grand tower. Power as I've never felt.",
    "80FFF5D3": "Foul rituals are doubtlessly underway inside and, if we're fortunate, the Hive magic we need to create more armor.",
    "80FFF5D5": "I must once again ask you to venture into the dark. Move quickly but carefully, Guardian.",
    "80FFF5D7": "Guardian. Eyes up.",
    "80FFF5D9": "There's Hashladûn—falling back deeper into the Keep. We've got her on the run.",
    "80FFF5DB": "It appears that way, but",
    "80FFF5DD": "But what?",
    "80FFF5DF": "Something is amiss. Continue your pursuit, Guardian. With caution.",
    "80FFF5E1": "It's Hashladûn. It must be. Only she could be responsible for the Keep's emanations.",
    "80FFF5E3": "She was presumed dead after Crota's fall. If she's alive if she's here the Hive's designs are dark indeed.",
    "80FFF5E5": "Whatever rituals are underway in the tower must be stopped. And Hashladûn must be eliminated.",
    "80FFF5E7": "Eris. It's over. Hashladûn is dead.",
    "80FFF5E9": "This is a relief to hear. But Hashladûn's presence is no coincidence. ",
    "80FFF5EB": "The Hive must have grander ambitions for the Pyramid's influences.",
    "80FFF5ED": "She had a tablet on her, one that describes a Cryptoglyph? I have no record of such an item.",
    "80FFF5EF": "That is precisely the information we came here for.",
    "80FFF5F1": "Return to me. There is much to discuss.",
    "80FFF5F3": "My scans suggest that crystal's locking down the elevator—and something's shielding it. Take a look around.",
    "80FFF5F5": "The bridge is lowering. Let's move.",
    "80FFF5F7": "She's certainly going through considerable effort to settle a grudge.",
    "80FFF5F9": "But vengeance, as you're aware, can be quite soothing. ",
    "80FFF5FB": "But vengeance can be quite soothing. We understand this as well as she does.",
    "80FFF5FD": "It is well beyond a grudge. You wounded her—and the Hive—in a way that cannot be healed.",
    "80FFF5FF": "It is beyond a mere grudge. They've been wounded in a way that cannot be healed.",
    "80FFF601": "Potent energies are gathering above you. A burning anticipation. Hashladûn yearns for your arrival.",
    "80FFF603": "She wasn't retreating—she was luring.",
    "80FFF605": "I thought the Hive preferred their strongholds underground. Why build a tower?",
    "80FFF607": "It was thought to be ceremonial in nature. The Vanguard monitored its construction but had 'more pressing concerns.'",
    "80FFF609": "Fools.",
    "80FFF60B": "The energy spilling from the tower suggests another purpose: I believe it amplifies Hive magic. ",
    "80FFF60D": "This may be where the Hive achieve their immunity to the Pyramid's influences.",
    "80FFF60F": "Wait, is that—?",
    "80FFF611": "Eris. We've got eyes on a Daughter of Crota.",
    "80FFF6CB": "I can't bring him back",
    "80FFF6CF": "They were too many everywhere devouring his Light.",
    "80FFF6D1": "I need to find the others, I need to tell them.",
    "80FFF6D3": "Wei Ning needs more time. It falls to us. First Pillars! To me!",
    "80FFF6D5": "Crota! Gunnvor the Dawncaller challenges you!",
    "80FFF6D7": "[battle cry]",
    "80FFF6D9": "We're going in, getting what Adonna wanted, and getting out. Do you copy?",
    "80FFF6DB": "…Hey. You listening?",
    "80FFF6DD": "Eir Ur Xol Yul Eir Ur Xol Yul",
    "80FFF6DF": "What are you doing? Hey—",
    "80FFF6E1": "EIR. UR. XOL. YUL. AKKA!",
    "80FFF6E3": "Ahhh'",
    "80FFF6E5": "I raised her 43 times. But on the 44th death, Omnigul's wormrot clung to her bones, rendered my powers useless on her.",
    "80FFF6E7": "Now my Light is fading. But if there's a chance to revive her, I won't leave her. I won't",
    "80FFF6E9": "This is the final transmission of Guren, Ghost of Toland whom you call the Shattered. He goes to hear the song of death. ",
    "80FFF6EB": "Nothing will deter him. None of you can stop him. Not anymore. ",
    "80FFF6ED": "Toland will hear the deathsinger's melody. He will redefine death, escape the Traveler's blunt samsara. ",
    "80FFF6EF": "He will sound the depths of the powers you so myopically fear. ",
    "80FFF6F1": "My only regret is that I will not live to see his triumph. ",
    "80FFF6F3": "No! I'll find a way to hide you, to hide your Light",
    "80FFF6F5": "There's no other way.",
    "80FFF6F7": "Don't ask me to do this. ",
    "80FFF6F9": "Just promise me one thing. ",
    "80FFF6FB": "Ghost please",
    "80FFF6FD": "Don't look back.",
    "80FFF6FF": "This will be my last transmission. Not sure I even have the Light left to send it. ",
    "80FFF701": "Thought I'd look for a Guardian on Luna. A First Light colonist. A downed Reef pilot. Maybe an Exo who never came home from the war.",
    "80FFF703": "Is it possible to miss someone you've never met?",
    "80FFF705": "How is this possible",
    "80FFF707": "Ghaul's dead. You're dead! The Young Wolf killed you! ",
    "80FFF709": "What is this? Hive magic? ",
    "80FFF70B": "I'll keep the feed live. Maybe the Praxics can make use of this data. ",
    "80FFF70D": "It's a song that's killing her. Gone on for about two minutes, thirty seconds now.",
    "80FFF70F": "I've wiped it from this transmission, in case its power extends through recorded media. ",
    "80FFF711": "If anyone is listening don't trust Toland. ",
    "80FFF713": "My time has come. Finally, finally ",
    "80FFF715": "When I go, you'll be free. It'll all be over. ",
    "80FFF717": "Omar do you think we'll see each other again?",
    "80FFF7FD": "As my new partner, couple things about me you should know: I've been pitting a lot of very bad people against some good ones. ",
    "80FFF801": "Could end up being trouble for the City and there's already been some collateral damage.",
    "80FFF803": "Hand to my heart I regret anyone who takes a dirt nap on account'a me. But I didn't survive by being indecisive. ",
    "80FFF805": "Through every age and era, Drifter's done what he had to.",
    "80FFF807": "The Warlords and the Iron Lords taught me that the Light is no gift. It brought hell to earth, and when we begged to die, it said hell no. ",
    "80FFF809": "They say the Dark Age was untold suffering. I could tell you a lot.",
    "80FFF80B": "Maybe next time. Go find the other tapes. I made you tapes. [chuckles]",
    "80FFF820": "No.",
    "80FFF824": "Do you regret this?",
    "80FFF826": "Nothing that ever mattered. I would die for those I love.",
    "80FFF828": "You lost everything.",
    "80FFF82A": "You've got to be joking. Eli? Your name is Eli?",
    "80FFF82C": "Hey now. My mama picked that name.",
    "80FFF82E": "Unless your mother's your Ghost, I don't see how",
    "80FFF830": "Listen, ORIN, names don't mean much anyway. Met a guy yesterday who called himself Randy.",
    "80FFF832": "What's wrong with Randy?",
    "80FFF834": "What isn't wrong with Randy? ",
    "80FFF836": "[laughs]",
    "80FFF838": "I'm sorry, I just—I really miss him.",
    "80FFF83A": "Yeah. Me too.",
    "80FFF83C": "[sniffles] How did you say you knew each other again?",
    "80FFF83E": "Oh, we, uh—Namqi and me were were buddies. Met in a little dive on Ceres.",
    "80FFF840": "Used to play cards. He talked about you a lot.",
    "80FFF842": "Said the Queen trusts you to talk to the Nine for her. [scoffs] That true?",
    "80FFF844": "[chuckle] Yeah. Sort of. Doesn't seem important anymore.",
    "80FFF846": "Yeah. Well you ever need a shoulder to cry on, I'm here for you.",
    "80FFF848": "THE CLEVER ONE IS IN PERIL.",
    "80FFF84A": "SHE WILL REGRET BEFORE THE END.",
    "80FFF84C": "Then she will die as one of us. Gladly.",
    "80FFF84E": "You don't know the meaning of that word.",
    "80FFF850": "This one searched far and wide for the Nine.",
    "80FFF852": "And I found them. I found you.",
    "80FFF854": "This one wanted power. She lost her little Light.",
    "80FFF856": "Why are you so keen on re-examining my motivation? I seek and I judge for you.",
    "80FFF858": "This one was brash. Immortal but young. Where thousands of gods fell around her, she would change the world.",
    "80FFF85A": "Didn't I?",
    "80FFF85C": "WHAT DOES IT WANT?",
    "80FFF85E": "Power.",
    "80FFF860": "WE DON'T UNDERSTAND.",
    "80FFF862": "THIS PLANE? WE CAN LEAVE THIS PLANE.",
    "80FFF864": "He has agency like you wouldn't believe. He can leave this place.",
    "80FFF866": "Then I'm afraid it's impossible to explain.",
    "80FFF868": "He hates violence. He hates it so much that he'll murder anyone who tries to inflict it on him.",
    "80FFF86A": "OF DEATH?",
    "80FFF86C": "He's afraid.",
    "80FFF86E": "Of everything.",
    "80FFF870": "WHAT DOES IT WANT?",
    "80FFF872": "You ask the same questions. You never listen.",
    "80FFF874": "Judgment.",
    "80FFF876": "What?",
    "80FFF878": "We don't understand.",
    "80FFF87A": "I have more agency as an agent than I ever did wielding the Light.",
    "80FFF87C": "Only two others have transcended their design.",
    "80FFF87E": "The first, an hourglass counting down with infinite patience.",
    "80FFF880": "The second, a forgotten blade sharpened anew.",
    "80FFF882": "And now, the Dredgen.",
    "80FFF884": "Visit us again. We wish for you to understand what we understand.",
    "80FFF886": "For now, it is my purpose to speak to you and you alone but only if you remain worthy.",
    "80FFF888": "The night falls.",
    "80FFF88A": "Out there, on the edge, your fate is a war unseen amid ruined fleets.",
    "80FFF88C": "Two women: feared, untrusted, forever at arm's length.",
    "80FFF88E": "Here, at home, your fate is a coin in the hand of a liar.",
    "80FFF890": "One man: afraid, untrustworthy, forever grasping.",
    "80FFF892": "You must reckon with yourself.",
    "80FFF894": "Can you see the path ahead?",
    "80FFF896": "Do you know the shape of your trial?",
    "80FFF898": "Hey, how you livin' sister? What can ol' Drifter do for you today? Wanna play some Gambit?",
    "80FFF89A": "The Dredgen has visions. They disturb him.",
    "80FFF89C": "You know about those, huh? You the one causin' them? Tell you right now I don't appreciate what they say.",
    "80FFF89E": "The gift is showing you what you must see. It is your fate.",
    "80FFF8A0": "No. I make my own choices.",
    "80FFF8A2": "If that is what you want to believe.",
    "80FFF8A4": "Freakin' psycho.",
    "80FFF8A6": "We have another truth to share with you.",
    "80FFF8A8": "The Dredgen should have told you himself.",
    "80FFF8AA": "But as always, fear keeps him from true potential.",
    "80FFF8AC": "Please. Open your mind.",
    "80FFF8AE": "I'm leaving. I'm going to go find them.",
    "80FFF8B0": "There is nothing out there for you, Orin!",
    "80FFF8B2": "Please don't pretend you care. This is a courtesy, Dredgen.",
    "80FFF8B4": "I don't use that name! Not anymore!",
    "80FFF8B6": "Your friend Callum says otherwise.",
    "80FFF8B8": "Hand to my heart, I'm not lying.",
    "80FFF8BA": "[chuckles] You can't even hear yourself.",
    "80FFF8BC": "Orin, please!",
    "80FFF8BE": "I'm going, Wu Ming. This 'friendship,' or whatever you want to call it it's over. Try not to get shot.",
    "80FFF8C0": "[growl of frustration]",
    "80FFF8C2": "You wanna go back to a thousand years of the Traveler's dogma, kid? Give up your freedom? Fine. You do you.",
    "80FFF8C4": "We stand at the precipice of history. What you do here changes the cosmic balance forever.",
    "80FFF8C6": "You have made allies of dangerous beings. Gods and god pretenders. How long before your company involves you in something you can't come back from?",
    "80FFF8C8": "Those I serve have so much to learn from you. You are their greatest curiosity. The agent on whom all fates converge.",
    "80FFF8CA": "The Dredgen presents a special prize to the Nine. He is an anomaly. An elemental balance. A grand experiment.",
    "80FFF8CC": "We remember his Trial.",
    "80FFF8CE": "THEY WILL ANNIHILATE HER.",
    "80FFF8D0": "No. She will manage.",

    "80FFF8E0": "WHY DOES IT DO THIS?",
    "80FFFA1F": "Welcome to a brave new world.",
    "80FFFA23": "Y'all have new roles in Gambit Prime. Invader. Collector. Sentry. Reaper. ",
    "80FFFA25": "And the hardware you'll build here in Reckoning? It'll enhance those roles. Make you look real mean.",
    "80FFFA27": "So go be mean, brother.",
    "80FFFA29": "So these are the measures you take for power. The Nine take note.",
    "80FFFA2B": "You do this for power. Even though power is fleeting.",
    "80FFFA2D": "Another step towards a stronger role. All for Dredgen's game. You must truly enjoy his company.",
    "80FFFA2F": "You fight to become a better warrior. But what use is that when the end of all things comes to this system?",
    "80FFFA31": "Xûr was first contact. The Trials were judgment. Reckoning is a lesson. For you. For us.",
    "80FFFA33": "Your city leaders. Foreign rulers. The Dredgen. You will do anything they ask in order to gain power. Fascinating.",
    "80FFFA35": "Everything dies. And you know it. You embrace it. The Nine are watching you.",
    "80FFFA37": "You destroy so the Dredgen can build. Like the changing of seasons.",
    "80FFFA39": "The echoes screamed as they died. And the Dredgen will consume them. He eats well with you around.",
    "80FFFA3B": "You excel at this game of death. The Dredgen will find a use for all those like you.",
    "80FFFA3D": "You have shown us there is art in destruction. We see why the Dredgen relies on you.",
    "80FFFA3F": "This battle was an open question. You gave us many answers.",
    "80FFFA41": "Bring us god-killers like you. We have so much to learn from your kind.",
    "80FFFA43": "You have no mercy. The Nine witness you and heed your lessons.",
    "80FFFA45": "You have achieved annihilation. Those I serve take note.",
    "80FFFA47": "For your enemy, you were the end. Revel in it.",
    "80FFFA49": "You left mercy behind and became death. The Dredgen will be pleased.",
    "80FFFA4B": "You brought them to their knees. May they rest in pieces.",
    "80FFFA4D": "You were unyielding. Exactly what the Dredgen is looking for. Are you pleased?",
    "80FFFA4F": "The Nine realms are yours to explore. But death shall follow you wherever you go.",
    "80FFFA51": "The worlds of the Nine are made of pure potential. Death is an intrinsic element.",
    "80FFFA53": "Are you frightened? Perhaps you should be.",
    "80FFFA55": "You seek to strengthen your role in the Dredgen's game. But power is not guaranteed.",
    "80FFFA57": "You don't fear death. Perhaps you should.",
    "80FFFA59": "For you, night has fallen. May it pass quickly.",
    "80FFFA5B": "You fought the future. It refused to change.",
    "80FFFA5D": "You did not go quietly.",
    "80FFFA5F": "For each of us, there is an end.",
    "80FFFA61": "May your opponents rest in pieces.",
    "80FFFA63": "Let us hear their screams.",
    "80FFFA65": "Destroy them.",
    "80FFFA67": "Show your enemy the end.",
    "80FFFA69": "The Nine await your results.",
    "80FFFA6B": "A game of death.",
    "80FFFA6D": "Make your mark while you can.",
    "80FFFA6F": "What can you teach the Nine?",
    "80FFFA71": "The Nine demand an exhibition.",
    "80FFFA73": "Fight the future.",
    "80FFFA75": "We begin this so you can finish it.",
    "80FFFA77": "We have so much to learn from you. Now kill.",
    "80FFFA79": "You have everything you need. Fight.",
    "80FFFA7B": "Show us how you adapt to this.",
    "80FFFA7D": "Shades of the king and his son await you. Relish this chance to slay them twice.",
    "80FFFA7F": "Your methods of destruction tell us everything.",
    "80FFFA81": "Reflections of the king and his son echo throughout this realm. Find them. Slay them.",
    "80FFFA83": "You've reached the peak. Now become death.",
    "80FFFA85": "This is the apex. Now slaughter them.",
    "80FFFA87": "All that you do, here at the end, the Nine see.",
    "80FFFA89": "Kill them all.",
    "80FFFA8B": "Finish this. Kill.",
    "80FFFA8D": "You have their attention, Guardian.",
    "80FFFA8F": "Time to fight.",
    "80FFFA91": "Search carefully, and you'll find that echoes of the king and his son have returned. Annihilate them.",
    "80FFFA93": "This realm remembers the king and his son. Kill them again.",
    "80FFFA95": "Time to die.",
    "80FFFA97": "Absolute power requires absolute sacrifice.",
    "80FFFA99": "Do you follow the Dredgen? He follows the path of the king and the king's son.",
    "80FFFA9B": "Heaven or hell. The choice is yours. Take them apart.",
    "80FFFA9D": "The Nine witness you. Don't disappoint them.",
    "80FFFA9F": "Fight and live.",
    "80FFFAA1": "Be our hands. Tear them apart.",
    "80FFFAA3": "You seek power in the Dredgen's game. Be relentless, and it is yours.",
    "80FFFAA5": "Your work here makes you more like the Dredgen. You want this?",
    "80FFFAA7": "The Nine hunger for understanding. The Dredgen simply hungers. What is it YOU seek?",
    "80FFFAA9": "The Nine possess theories about your kind. Let's test them.",
    "80FFFAAB": "This reckoning is a joint venture with the Dredgen. What part will you play?",
    "80FFFAAD": "The Nine are fascinated by your kind. What can you teach them?",
    "80FFFAAF": "This realm shall test everything you are.",
    "80FFFAB1": "This place is an open question. The Nine wish to know you.",
    "80FFFAB3": "The Dredgen said you were coming. He has carved a path to the realms of the Nine.",
    "80FFFAB5": "You are free to explore. Those I serve wish it. Just remember: The Dredgen's army of echoes are shaping this place to his desire. And what they take, they keep.",
    "80FFFAB9": "Think of Xûr as a prototype. I became the next model. A fresh attempt at communication.",
    "80FFFABD": "Namqi is still out there somewhere. Waiting.",
    "80FFFABF": "Eli. I remember his name was Eli.",
    "80FFFAC1": "He's changed. I hardly recognize him.",
    "80FFFAC3": "Do you ever mourn what you've become?",
    "80FFFAC5": "I never asked to be raised as a Guardian. I died. I was meant to stay dead.",
    "80FFFAC7": "You cannot ask a human to truly understand or empathize with the life of an ant. ",
    "80FFFAC9": "They are the humans, and you—you are the ant. ",
    "80FFFACB": "I sought a different power, one outside the petty balance of Light and Dark.",
    "80FFFACD": "At least this, I chose. I regret it. But I chose it.",
    "80FFFACF": "He does not want it, but he cannot avoid it. I want it, but it will not come.",
    "80FFFAD1": "In time, they may grow tired of me. They may make another prototype.",
    "80FFFAD3": "I see everywhere. I touch everything. And the more time I spend with them, the less I understand humanity.",
    "80FFFAD5": "Dredgen hears exactly what I want him to hear.",
    "80FFFAD7": "Dredgen has you twisted around his finger.",
    "80FFFAD9": "Dredgen is in over his little head.",
    "80FFFADB": "Dredgen is playing with fire.",
    "80FFFADD": "Dredgen is stuck. He doesn't know it yet.",
    "80FFFADF": "Dredgen is lying. Who will punish him?",
    "80FFFAE1": "Dredgen is living a nightmare.",
    "80FFFAE3": "The Queen and her hunter send their regards.",
    "80FFFAE5": "You seem confused. Your goal is simple. Fight the future.",
    "80FFFAE7": "All of life is defined in unrecorded dimensions, unnumbered. ",
    "80FFFAE9": "Numbered though they may be, they are formless.",
    "80FFFAEB": "Death is coming. You are a living embodiment.",
    "80FFFAED": "Three have seen the way so far. Will you be the fourth?",
    "80FFFAEF": "The end of an age is coming. ",
    "80FFFAF1": "Can you believe in what you cannot see?",
    "80FFFAF3": "We cannot escape. We have tried. We have tried. The pull is too strong.",
    "80FFFAF5": "Their awareness spreads everywhere, but it is always drawn inexorably back to this system.",
    "80FFFBE1": "My first home in exile was the Menagerie. Cozy, isn't it?",
    "80FFFBE5": "The Menagerie was once my prison. Now it's your proving ground.",
    "80FFFBE7": "The Menagerie is where I was reborn in the image of perfection. So, too, shall you be.",
    "80FFFBE9": "The Menagerie is the oldest deck of the Leviathan. My home in exile.",
    "80FFFBEB": "Ghaul and the Red Legion imprisoned me here, long ago. [laughs] Look at them now.",
    "80FFFBED": "The Leviathan was once a prison ship. The Menagerie was my cell. It's beautiful in its own way.",
    "80FFFBEF": "I keep the Menagerie for your amusement. And mine.",
    "80FFFBF1": "Behold my Menagerie! A place of wonder and delight. A place of gratification.",
    "80FFFBF3": "I promised you true power. Here, you shall find it.",
    "80FFFBF5": "[boisterous laughter]",
    "80FFFBF7": "Light the way, Titan.",
    "80FFFBF9": "Have you the strength for my Menagerie, Titan?",
    "80FFFBFB": "Your people pride themselves on their bravery, Titan. Are you worthy of your tribe?",
    "80FFFBFD": "I can taste your determination, Titan.",
    "80FFFBFF": "Light the way, Hunter.",
    "80FFFC01": "You will have to be quick to survive my Menagerie, Hunter.",
    "80FFFC03": "Lost treasure awaits you, Hunter. [laughs]",
    "80FFFC05": "Your people pride themselves on their cunning, Hunter. Are you worthy of your tribe?",
    "80FFFC07": "Light the way, Warlock.",
    "80FFFC09": "We shall see whether your wits win the day, Warlock.",
    "80FFFC0B": "Your people pride themselves on their wisdom, Warlock. Are you worthy of your tribe?",
    "80FFFC0D": "I can smell your anticipation, Warlock.",
    "80FFFC0F": "Your passion and joy reminds me of my own, Guardian. You are a wonder to behold.",
    "80FFFC11": "You know how to exploit Hive ritual. Magnificent. Perhaps I can convince you to dance with the dark",
    "80FFFC13": "You know how to play by Hive rules. Have you ever considered you might make a good Hive? Hah. That'll be the day.",
    "80FFFC15": "You've proven your dominance time and again by rite of sword logic. And yet the Hive will never stop. Ha! Hypocrites.",
    "80FFFC17": "The end of everything is coming. And the Hive have long been carving a path to welcome it.",
    "80FFFC19": "The Hive can be beaten. But what they serve is another matter entirely.",
    "80FFFC1B": "The Taken King and his son are not the pinnacle of Hive evolution. I have seen the end. Stronger, subtler foes make their way to you. ",
    "80FFFC1D": "Death and destruction will amuse me 'til the day I die. But the efficiency with which you plow through my horde is slightly alarming.",
    "80FFFC1F": "You peeled that Ogre's armor like a shell off a beetle. How vulgar. I'd like to see that again.",
    "80FFFC21": "You used your own foe's power against him. You can see weaknesses in the Dark and exploit them. I'd be offended if I didn't enjoy you so much.",
    "80FFFC23": "Paracausality. A property of your tribe. Let us see it in action.",
    "80FFFC25": "Your people have an ability to commune with powers that some might call magic. So, too, do the Hive.",
    "80FFFC27": "This room honors the Fulminator, another of my former Shadows. She was a delight.",
    "80FFFC29": "Ah, the Arkborn! Sentient energy, crackling with potential. And the Fulminator was brightest of them all",
    "80FFFC2B": "I'm afraid I had to break an agreement with one of my former Shadows. A tiny detail. No matter to you.",
    "80FFFC2D": "Have you ever tried to free an energy-people from their interstellar conduits? It is a task only I, Emperor Calus, could undertake.",
    "80FFFC2F": "There are captive Arkborn all around you. Bathe in them. Dab their essence behind your ears.",
    "80FFFC31": "Guardians, Hive, and Arkborn. What a delight. What a truly unprecedented delight.",
    "80FFFC33": "Let us see how you fare in this trial.",
    "80FFFC35": "My Hive will harry you, Light-born. Step lightly!",
    "80FFFC37": "The Vex have fed my Leviathan well during my time here. She is fatter and more glorious than ever.",
    "80FFFC39": "The soil of Nessus makes a fine wine. One with a slightly metallic nose and the afterbite of Vex radiolaria",
    "80FFFC3B": "The Vex labor toward a future where they are the last living things. [chuckles] If they only knew what I know!",
    "80FFFC3D": "Have you seen my robots? An idle amusement, inspired in some small part by the Vex.",
    "80FFFC3F": "Rip off their heads, Little Light. I crave your ferocity.",
    "80FFFC41": "On my journey home from the deep black, I encountered many races. None as joyful as the Vex.",
    "80FFFC43": "The Vex are harmony incarnate. Give them time, and they will solve life itself.",
    "80FFFC45": "When the end comes, the Vex will die like everything else. But until then, they have you to help with that.",
    "80FFFC47": "Electrifying. [chuckles]",
    "80FFFC49": "Your capacity to absorb energy seems boundless. We shall have to test your true limits someday.",
    "80FFFC4B": "You are worthy of the Fulminator's legacy.",
    "80FFFC4D": "My Councilors wrested only a fraction of the Arkborn free of their world. Together, you and I could take them all.",
    "80FFFC4F": "Cleverly done.",
    "80FFFC51": "Once again, the Light proves dominant. Ah, you are a ferocious little thing, aren't you?",
    "80FFFC53": "Tomorrow is for reflection. Today is for glory.",
    "80FFFC55": "Revel in your victory. Let it fill you with joy and mirth.",
    "80FFFC57": "Ah, brave adventurer, your cruelty makes me jealous. You will kill with barely a thought. Everything is an unthinking, unfeeling target. Marvelous!",
    "80FFFC59": "The Arkborn will know your name. I will make sure of it.",
    "80FFFC5B": "The Vex crafted what they thought was the perfect algorithm to end you. To see it fail You must have a magnificent brain.",
    "80FFFC5D": "The Vex are mechanical shells, cocoons for something grander. Ah, their methods inspire me.",
    "80FFFC5F": "Humanity of Earth is the only opponent I have ever seen contend with the Vex and win.",
    "80FFFC61": "The fluid at the center of a Vex is just a body. Crushable. Killable. Delightful.",
    "80FFFC63": "The Vex are merciless. Cold. Like heat death at the end of the universe.",
    "80FFFC65": "The Vex are slow, plodding. But they will never stop, never waver.",
    "80FFFC67": "Left to your own devices, how many Vex would you kill? Where would you stop? Are they the machines? Or are you?",
    "80FFFC69": "Good. You met their force with force. Pace yourself. The Vex will never stop.",
    "80FFFC6B": "As every empire expands, it must bring new peoples into its loving embrace. Behold my Hive.",
    "80FFFC6D": "What is a Menagerie without an array of peoples, of places, of delights?",
    "80FFFC6F": "You are as much of a part of this Menagerie as my Hive.",
    "80FFFC71": "The Hive are an unimaginative people. I believe I can show them another way.",
    "80FFFC73": "The Menagerie is a proving ground for all my new Tribes. I am eager to see how my Hive fare.",
    "80FFFC75": "Traveler-spawn and worm-spawn. Can either be swayed to a new god? ",
    "80FFFC77": "My Hive are somewhat unruly. [laughs]",
    "80FFFC79": "Ah, this shall be amusing.",
    "80FFFC7B": "The Hive understand nothing but power. Show them yours.",
    "80FFFC7D": "These Hive serve me. But they're still Hive. Annihilate them.",
    "80FFFC7F": "Now. One final test of your skill and cunning. ",
    "80FFFC81": "I have a very serious question for you, Little Light Can you dance?",
    "80FFFC83": "You are nearly at the end. Declare yourself.",
    "80FFFC85": "I do enjoy this Minotaur. Play nicely with my little toy.",
    "80FFFC87": "And now, the finale",
    "80FFFC89": "I want to remember this performance as I fall asleep tonight, Guardian. Exceed my expectations.",
    "80FFFC8B": "Are you worthy of my Menagerie? Are you worthy of my regard?",
    "80FFFC8D": "Live to your potential!",
    "80FFFC8F": "I see what you can be. Show me what you ARE.",
    "80FFFC91": "Come now! Don't lose momentum!",
    "80FFFC93": "Magnificent!",
    "80FFFC95": "See how brightly the flames burn. As hot and vicious as your own passion",
    "80FFFC97": "Ah, and to think. This was but an appetizer.",
    "80FFFC99": "Look closely, my Scribes. See how he fights!",
    "80FFFC9B": "Let's see what the Menagerie has to offer you",
    "80FFFC9D": "Yes! Yes! Feast on your enemies! Gorge yourself on death!",
    "80FFFC9F": "Your glory is my glory. Fight on.",
    "80FFFCA1": "I have admired you for some time now. [laughs] You never fail to inspire.",
    "80FFFCA3": "If you wish to grow fat from strength, then fight every battle on your terms.",
    "80FFFCA5": "When you become my Shadow, I shall wreath you in gold. I shall build you monuments...",
    "80FFFCA7": "The cunning of your Hunter tribe never fails to amuse me!",
    "80FFFCA9": "You are as swift as you are lithe, Hunter And as beautiful as any of my Councilors.",
    "80FFFCAB": "Your cunning is impressive. You could lead raids on the vaults of my enemies, help me reclaim the lost Athenaeum worlds. The mantle of Hunter Shadow is yours if you live to take it.",
    "80FFFCAD": "A feat of strength worthy of your Titan tribe!",
    "80FFFCAF": "You are as immoveable as you are strong, Titan And as beautiful as any of my Gladiators.",
    "80FFFCB1": "I find your strength intoxicating to behold. I see the overwhelming power of your Guardian tribe in you. The mantle of Titan Shadow will be yours someday.",
    "80FFFCB3": "Do all those of your Warlock tribe match your brilliance?",
    "80FFFCB5": "You are as resilient as you are graceful, Warlock And as beautiful as any of my Scribes.",
    "80FFFCB7": "I see you. I see the wisdom and intelligence of your Guardian tribe in you. You'll make a fine Warlock Shadow someday.",
    "80FFFCB9": "The riches of my Menagerie are yours. You've earned them.",
    "80FFFCBB": "A glorious execution! A marvel of a bloodbath!",
    "80FFFCBD": "Yes! Victory. Triumph. Taste it; let it melt on your tongue. This moment is yours.",
    "80FFFCBF": "Feast on this victory, my friend! And know that your benevolent Emperor led you to this succulent trough!",
    "80FFFCC1": "Good, good, very good! Come! Enjoy my gifts!",
    "80FFFCC3": "There are none quite like you, Guardian of Guardians.",
    "80FFFCC5": "Ohoho, you've proven once more that your frail little body holds so much promise...",
    "80FFFCC7": "[laughs] Yet another glorious execution!",
    "80FFFCC9": "Ha! I will need another Hydra. You've ruined this one.",
    "80FFFCCB": "I've always suspected you were the zenith of your kind. Come. Be rewarded.",
    "80FFFCCD": "You are so close to victory, Guardian. Can you taste it? I can.",
    "80FFFCCF": "I have one more pet for you to overcome. I think you two will put on a marvelous show.",
    "80FFFCD1": "You'll have to get intimately close to finish this one, Light-born. Don't be afraid.",
    "80FFFCD3": "One final test awaits you.",
    "80FFFCD5": "This one is fat with strength A worthy final opponent for you.",
    "80FFFCD7": "The final act is always my favorite. Will you triumph, or will you fall? It's delicious to wonder.",
    "80FFFCD9": "This is your final test. Revel in it.",
    "80FFFCDB": "I hope you've sharpened your sword logic.",
    "80FFFCDD": "In the gladiator pits of Torobatl, I saw dozens of mighty boxers compete in hand-to-hand combat, armorless and glistening with blood. This Ogre is worthy of them.",
    "80FFFCDF": "Show me again the eternal struggle between Guardian and Hive.",
    "80FFFCE1": "You prove again and again that you can best the Hive according to their own vaunted sword logic. But they will never stop. [scoffs] Hypocrites.",
    "80FFFCE3": "The Hive believe that they'll win this system through sheer tenacity and force of will. That simply believing they're right makes it so. Ha! You're living proof they will fail.",
    "80FFFCE5": "Delightful how you carved them up. You understand sword logic better than the Hive themselves.",
    "80FFFCE7": "The Hive will be present at the dimming of the world. I have high hopes you'll be there to meet them.",
    "80FFFCE9": "The Hive cannot be convinced they are wrong. Sword logic is the only argument they understand.",
    "80FFFCEB": "The darkness comes from a vast emptiness, and the Hive have hunger to match.",
    "80FFFCED": "Left unchecked, the Hive will consume all. They understand strength. And growth.",
    "80FFFCEF": "Scribes! The Knights have fallen. Call for fresh fodder, we must restock our larder",
    "80FFFCF1": "The Hive are an older race than you. Nobler, they believe. Led by royalty with cosmic legacy. You've shown them that legacy means only as much as they can live up to.",
    "80FFFCF3": "These Hive are mine. You know they're mine. And you killed them anyway. Why do you do this, when you know I could end you for it? [laughs] I enjoy you, Guardian.",
    "80FFFCF5": "When my enemies rose against me, I took their greatest talents and twisted them to my advantage.",
    "80FFFCF7": "They call it 'sword logic.' Ha! Let us make that a little more tangible",
    "80FFFCF9": "Whet yourself against this challenge. Gleam with wicked sharpness.",
    "80FFFCFB": "Mmm, this one will make you sweat [chuckles]",
    "80FFFCFD": "Let me see you use your hands, Light-born.",
    "80FFFCFF": "Rend them. Tear them. Sunder them with your vicious edge.",
    "80FFFD01": "Show me you know how to seize an advantage, Guardian.",
    "80FFFD03": "Skewer them upon their own logic.",
    "80FFFD05": "A new test. I expect you'll be worthy of it.",
    "80FFFD07": "In the end, there will be no bombs or swords. No logics at all.",
    "80FFFD09": "Through the dark toward the bliss of salvation! [laughs]",
    "80FFFD0B": "You cast light wherever you go, young one.",
    "80FFFD0D": "Revel in your victory, Light-born.",
    "80FFFD0F": "Your people do not appreciate you as I do.",
    "80FFFD11": "Well, that was a pleasant diversion, was it not?",
    "80FFFD13": "[dark laughter]",
    "80FFFD15": "You grow mightier with every fight.",
    "80FFFD17": "How I admire your tenacity! Your will!",
    "80FFFD19": "Ugh, what a slaughter! If I am to ever find a new Hive Shadow, I will have to extend my search.",
    "80FFFD1B": "I need a new Hive Shadow. One of your people took his head off. It was quite the melee.",
    "80FFFD1D": "Onward!",
    "80FFFD1F": "Hmm You have a talent for balance, but you will have to unlearn it. Excess! In all things, excess!",
    "80FFFD21": "Ah, what vigor! You deserve to be rewarded.",
    "80FFFD23": "Are you weary, brave warrior? You could always repose upstairs in the royal baths.",
    "80FFFD25": "All that labor for the Awoken—but they will never love you as I do.",
    "80FFFD27": "Stunning. Scribes! Mark this down!",
    "80FFFD29": "Good. Good. Now, will you consider living here upon the Leviathan? If you do, you must never return to the Dreaming City.",
    "80FFFD2B": "Cleverly done. You please me.",
    "80FFFD2D": "All glory to you, Guardian of Guardians!",
    "80FFFD2F": "If it pleases you, we shall depose the Awoken Queen and her Wrath. We will gild their bones and fashion you a beautiful collar.",
    "80FFFD31": "Step lightly, young one. My Knights are hungry.",
    "80FFFD33": "There is a certain thrill in being chased, pursued by a voracious horde",
    "80FFFD35": "Stand united and fall. But divide, and you shall conquer!",
    "80FFFD37": "The Hive tribe is stubborn, inflexible. Those who do not pledge loyalty must be culled.",
    "80FFFD39": "Light and Shadow, intimately intertwined. Will you light the way, or will you be snuffed out?",
    "80FFFD3B": "These Hive are mine, commanded by my Hive Shadow. I have asked them to test all that you are.",
    "80FFFD3D": "These Hive will give their all to end you. Because that's what I've asked of them.",
    "80FFFD3F": "Oryx and Crota could not finish you. But those they serve might.",
    "80FFFD41": "I have seen the end of all worlds. And the Hive are there to play a part.",
    "80FFFD43": "The Hive are governed by power. Show them you have the right to rule.",
    "80FFFD45": "Show me that you can think on your feet.",
    "80FFFD47": "Here, I honor my Ace-Defiant. Agile! Lean! And thoroughly dead. [laughs]",
    "80FFFD49": "You must be as the Sindû. Fly swiftly, my hero.",
    "80FFFD4B": "How is your endurance?",
    "80FFFD4D": "Many Guardians have impressed me in this Gauntlet. It will disappoint me if you fail. Do not disappoint me.",
    "80FFFD4F": "Amuse me, Traveler-spawn.",
    "80FFFD51": "I love my Gauntlet. You, too, will love my Gauntlet.",
    "80FFFD53": "The Vex seek a perfect future. Instead, show them a perfect end.",
    "80FFFD55": "It would be a great shame to see you fall to the Vex.",
    "80FFFD57": "This should be rich. [laughs]",
    "80FFFD59": "You can rush headlong into battle with joy in your heart. But can you bait a wary opponent into attack?",
    "80FFFD5B": "Here is where you prove yourself.",
    "80FFFD5D": "Do you even see your enemies as you cut them down? You will see this one. I've made sure of it.",
    "80FFFD5F": "I expect a grand finale. Do not disappoint me.",
    "80FFFD61": "My Hydra is cautious. It must know how many Vex you've felled here today.",
    "80FFFD63": "Show me what your Light can do!",
    "80FFFD65": "You've reached the end of my Menagerie, but can you conquer this final challenge?",
    "80FFFD67": "I am watching, Little Light. My Scribes stand at the ready to record your every action.",
    "80FFFD69": "May your triumph here be decisive.",
    "80FFFD6B": "You've come too far to hold back now. Free yourself from all distractions. This fight, this moment? This is all there is.",
    "80FFFD6D": "Good. Very good.",
    "80FFFD6F": "[chuckles] Ah, the Gauntlet never gets old",
    "80FFFD71": "It is still incredible to me to see you reconstructed from cinder and ash. I've met no other creatures like you Guardians.",
    "80FFFD73": "A modest performance, but it could be improved.",
    "80FFFD75": "Your agility is stirring.",
    "80FFFD77": "Your speed is striking!",
    "80FFFD79": "Have I made you breathless? [chuckles]",
    "80FFFD7B": "Beauty in motion, o champion mine. Ha, you please me.",
    "80FFFD7D": "The Vex understand nothing but their core algorithms. They will never stop until their directives are complete.",
    "80FFFD7F": "The Vex are organic. Beneath that armor, they're soft. Delicate. Take them apart.",
    "80FFFD81": "These Vex belong to me. When one indoctrinates a Vex Mind, its entire subtype comes with it.",
    "80FFFD83": "I am trying to teach my Vex to enjoy boundless pleasure. So far, results have been mixed.",
    "80FFFD85": "Welcome to my Menagerie. I thought I'd introduce you to my Vex, first.",
    "80FFFD87": "I've sent my Vex to greet you. Do tell me if they prove inhospitable.",
    "80FFFD89": "The Vex are a viral Tribe. Their very nature fascinates me.",
    "80FFFD8B": "My Vex are indifferent to the sweetmeats of the Dark, but the Light seems to compel them",
    "80FFFD8D": "Come! Step into the Menagerie! Do you like my Vex?",
    "80FFFD8F": "Your first challenge shall be lighting the way. And do take care with my Vex.",
    "80FFFD91": "Here, this room is my little joke. A fitting tribute to the Awoken Queen. [chuckles]",
    "80FFFD93": "Light and Dark, Sky and Deep, misery and war Why fret over such things when you can simply enjoy yourself?",
    "80FFFD95": "The Awoken tribe is a puzzle to me. I should like some of them for my Menagerie.",
    "80FFFD97": "If I stocked my Menagerie with specimens from the Awoken tribe, would you waver? Or would you fight on?",
    "80FFFD99": "The Awoken Queen believes she can forestall the end that is coming. She's a stupid child. A fool. Let us mock her here.",
    "80FFFD9B": "There is a great riddle between the Awoken and the Hive in the city that dreams. Your people would do well to ignore it.",
    "80FFFD9D": "Another test of your mettle. Begin.",
    "80FFFD9F": "Many demand your trust. The Traveler. The Awoken Queen. Trust only in me, your beloved Emperor Calus.",
    "80FFFDA1": "[dark laughter]",
    "80FFFDA3": "This trial always sets my Hive into a frenzy...",
    "80FFFDA5": "Ah, for something so frail and small, you have such strength!",
    "80FFFDA7": "You'd think the Vex would do a better job of predicting your victories by now. [laughs]",
    "80FFFDA9": "Those Vex were unworthy of my Menagerie. Press on.",
    "80FFFDAB": "I will need a worthier challenge for you, Light-born.",
    "80FFFDAD": "You are [sigh] singular.",
    "80FFFDAF": "Now that you're warmed up, let's get to the rest, shall we?",
    "80FFFDB1": "You relish destruction as I relish you.",
    "80FFFDB3": "My favorite Vex Mind has built an algorithm to erase your Light. Perhaps you'll meet, in some dark corner",
    "80FFFDB5": "[hearty laughter]",
    "80FFFDB7": "I'll need more Vex. You Little Lights keep taking them apart. It's delightful.",
    "80FFFDB9": "Ha! I will drape you in the spoils of your victory, my champion. I will bathe you in the green fire.",
    "80FFFDBB": "For all the Witch-Queen's cunning, her nieces and nephews grow no wiser. Such a pity.",
    "80FFFDBD": "The Hive are such a desperately uncurious tribe, and that that is what will doom them",
    "80FFFDBF": "As I expected. You are as resplendent in victory as ever.",
    "80FFFDC1": "Did you enjoy the massacre? You were a wonder to behold.",
    "80FFFDC3": "If only your frail face had tusks, I would cap them with gold.",
    "80FFFDC5": "Scribes, take note of this victory. Take note!",
    "80FFFDC7": "Very good, my champion. But your mighty works are not yet finished.",
    "80FFFDC9": "The Hive are driven by their hunger. There is weakness in their grasping, and you punished them for it.",
    "80FFFDCB": "What a show! Such finesse to your technique, such... style. I could watch you all day.",
    "80FFFDCD": "Encore! Encore!",
    "80FFFDCF": "The mightiest Vex you have felled are but farmers, engineers, managers. The day they send real warriors [laughs]",
    "80FFFDD1": "You made it kneel for you. [boisterous laughter] And you are so small!",
    "80FFFDD3": "You never cease to entertain. We will make an inspired pair, you and I.",
    "80FFFDD5": "You were made to become my Shadow. Of this, I am sure.",
    "80FFFDD7": "Every bristle on my hide is standing on end, o champion mine. What a performance.",
    "80FFFDD9": "You were more than worthy of my Menagerie today, but your endurance over time will prove your true value.",
    "80FFFDDB": "Ah What a delicious performance. I shall cherish it as I drift off to sleep tonight.",
    "80FFFDDD": "Uncompromising! Let me stud you with jewels! Gild you with the purest alloys!",
    "80FFFDDF": "That was a delight. Claim your reward.",
    "81001709": "What is this? Are we having a good time? You didn't even TRY to deploy the Breaker.",
    "8100170C": "Your opponents had to move Heaven and Earth to defeat you. Challenge them again.",
    "8100170D": "You gave it your all, but the enemy vault still stands.",
    "8100170E": "Not that time. Opponents defended their vault.",
    "8100170F": "Not enough. Opponents defended their vault.",
    "81001710": "Breakthrough.",
    "81001711": "Breaker calibrated!",
    "81001712": "Breaker calibration complete!",
    "81001713": "Breaker ready!",
    "81001714": "Fall back to vault! The Breaker is lost.",
    "81001715": "Back up to vault! Opponents have the Breaker!",
    "81001716": "Withdraw to vault! Enemy has the Breaker!",
    "81001717": "Enemy deployed Breaker! Defend your vault!",
    "81001718": "Enemy deployed Breaker! Guard your vault!",
    "81001719": "I can't argue that one. Your vault's been hacked. That's the match.",
    "8100171A": "Take that vault!",
    "8100171B": "Make that vault yours!",
    "8100171C": "Hack that vault! Hack it!",
    "8100171D": "Opponent's vault hacked! Fantastic.",
    "8100171E": "Your team hacked the opposing vault.",
    "8100171F": "Allies hacked the opposing vault.",
    "81001720": "The opponents' vault has been hacked. Good.",
    "81001721": "Allies took the opposing vault. Effective teamwork.",
    "81001722": "Hooooooold!",
    "81001723": "You're still alive, so fight!",
    "81001724": "Plant your feet, and let none pass!",
    "81001725": "Wait for it",
    "81001726": "Nearly there",
    "81001727": "One moment",
    "81001728": "Hack in progress!",
    "81001729": "Your vault is exposed! Defend it with your life!",
    "8100172A": "Vault exposed! Defend it! Nothing else matters!",
    "8100172B": "Your vault's vulnerable! Protect it!",
    "8100172C": "Opponents can hack your vault! Defend!",
    "8100172D": "Vault exposed! Protect it at all costs!",
    "8100172E": "Opponents have match point! Think that matters? Fight them.",
    "8100172F": "Enemy has match point! Look them in the eyes and beat them.",
    "81001730": "Enemy has match point! Defy them!",
    "81001731": "Opponent's vault exposed! Hack it, or they win!",
    "81001732": "Opponent's vault exposed! Take it, or face defeat!",
    "81001733": "Opposing vault exposed! Your only option is to take it!",
    "81001734": "Your opponents lead. But it's not over.",
    "81001735": "Opposing team leads. Take it from them!",
    "81001736": "Opponents have the lead. Break them!",
    "81001737": "You've deployed the Breaker!",
    "81001738": "Breaker in flight! Well done!",
    "81001739": "The Breaker is yours! Now break through!",
    "8100173A": "Your opponents take this one. Plenty of vaults left. Fight another.",
    "8100173B": "The spoils go to your opponents.",
    "8100173C": "I can't argue results. Your opponents out-maneuvered you.",
    "8100173D": "Your opponents proved to be the better thieves.",
    "8100173E": "Your opponents must have some experience in thievery.",
    "8100173F": "I have to give that one to your opponents.",
    "81001740": "Your opponents have proven they belong on the lawless frontier.",
    "81001741": "Your opponents have won. But look at it this way: They're embezzlers.",
    "81001742": "So your opponents are better at swindling than you. That's okay. That's fine.",
    "81001743": "Those are the drums of war! It all comes to this.",
    "81001744": "Do you hear it? This is where it ends—for good or ill.",
    "81001745": "Guardians live for moments like these. Finish it!",
    "81001746": "Your vault is exposed! Win or lose, the end has come!",
    "81001747": "Hold strong. The lead is yours!",
    "81001748": "You have the lead. Keep it.",

    "8100174A": "Match point! The vault is all you need! Hack it!",
    "8100174B": "Match point. Hack the vault, and the win is yours.",
    "8100174C": "Match point! Take the vault and win!",
    "8100174D": "Not this time. Your vault's been hacked.",
    "8100174E": "Opponents hacked your vault. Get them next time.",
    "8100174F": "Opponents hacked your vault.",
    "81001750": "Opponents hacked your vault. It's not over!",
    "81001751": "Opponents took your vault? So what? Keep fighting.",
    "81001752": "Opposing vault exposed. You want to win? Take it!",
    "81001753": "Hack the enemy vault, and this match is yours!",
    "81001754": "You've nearly won. Hack the vault, and this is yours!",
    "81001756": "They're hacking your vault!",
    "81001757": "The match is tied. Who will break through?",
    "81001758": "Dead even. Ties are meant to be broken!",
    "81001759": "It's tied. Mow through!",
    "8100175A": "Fight to deploy the Breaker, then hack your opponents' vault!",
    "8100175B": "Deploy the Breaker, then hack the opposing vault!",
    "8100175C": "First things first: Deploy that Breaker before your opponents do!",
    "8100175D": "Deploy that Breaker, and you're off to a strong start!",
    "8100175E": "Get to that Breaker and deploy it before your opponents do. Nothing else matters!",
    "8100175F": "Your team deployed the Breaker!",
    "81001760": "Breaker deployed by your side!",
    "81001761": "Allies deployed the Breaker!",
    "81001762": "Your side deployed the Breaker!",
    "81001763": "Your team has the Breaker!",
    "81001764": "Vault exposed! Hold the line! Your survival depends on it!",
    "81001765": "Vault exposed! The line must hold. Fail here, and you concede the match!",
    "81001766": "Vault exposed! The line must be drawn here! Falter, and your opponent wins!",
    "81001767": "Good work. Who'd have thought Fallen tech would be such an effective training tool?",
    "81001768": "And so it ends. The spoils go to you, Guardian.",
    "8100176A": "I see you'll be well-suited to succeed on the lawless frontier. Good. ",
    "8100176C": "Excellent. Don't let this training go to waste. You're set to rob the Tangled Shore blind.",
    "8100176E": "You're like a thief in the night. A loud, roaring night. Where everyone has a gun.",
    "81001770": "When I take the enemy vault, I look them in the eye, and I tell them, 'This is mine now.' I see you do, too.",
    "81001771": "I designed Breakthrough to train you in the art of bank robbery. I believe I've succeeded. More or less.",
    "81001773": "I think you're ready for the lawless frontier. Get out there, and rob the Fallen blind.",
    "81001775": "What have I created? The Tangled Shore won't know what hit them. But it'll be you.",
    "81001776": "Opposing vault is ripe for the taking!",
    "81001777": "Opposing vault exposed! Crush them and hack it!",
    "81001778": "Opposing vault is vulnerable. Hack it!",
    "81001779": "Opponent's vault has been exposed! Take it!",
    "8100177A": "Opponent's vault is open to attack. Take it!",
    "8100177B": "Your vault is exposed, but hold the line, and your opponent is finished.",
    "8100177C": "Your vault's exposed, but hold off your enemy, and you take this match!",
    "8100177D": "Your vault's exposed. But you could still take this match. Hold the line!",
    "8100177E": "It's dead even, but the enemy vault is exposed! Take it and end this!",
    "8100177F": "Time's up, and you fought like a demon to keep your vault! Good!",
    "81001780": "Time's up, and your vault still stands! Superb.",
    "81001781": "Your team could hold that vault through another Collapse. Well done.",
    "81001782": "Vault hacked! The spoils of victory are yours!",
    "81001783": "Vault hacked! The spoils of victory are yours! [pause] You can't actually keep it, though. I need it back for the next match. They only give me so much budget for this.",
    "81001784": "For a moment there, I thought Death had his bony hand around your throat. But you snapped his arm. You're disgusting.",
    "81001786": "Neither team could find purchase. Fight them again.",
    "81001787": "Wasn't convinced by either side. Fight on!",
    "81001788": "Both teams can do better. Show me.",
    "81001789": "You hacked the enemy vault. Superb.",
    "8100178B": "You hacked the opposing vault. Impressive.",
    "8100178D": "Enemy vault is yours. Well done.",
    "8100178F": "Full capture achieved! This one goes to you.",
    "81001792": "Maintain momentum! Control the zones!",
    "81001793": "You're ahead. Don't get sloppy. Take the zones.",
    "81001794": "You have the lead, but you haven't won. Take the zones!",
    "81001795": "Not this time. Opponents achieved full capture.",
    "81001796": "Enemy team completed a full capture.",
    "81001797": "Opponents have a full capture.",
    "81001798": "Your opponents are close to victory!",
    "81001799": "That's what I call an exercise in territory defense. Saving that feed for the rookies.",
    "8100179A": "All this in defense of the City. And you were a shining example today.",
    "8100179C": "We lost the Tower once. Never again. Do it like this every time.",
    "8100179D": "You certainly marked your territory today. Keep it up.",
    "8100179E": "Control zones strongly held. Well done.",
    "8100179F": "The zones were yours to take. I want to see this effort from you always.",
    "810017A0": "Powerful defense. The zones strongly held. You are an example for all Guardians.",
    "810017A1": "The zones, Guardian. They're all that matter!",
    "810017A3": "Defeat your opponents if you wish, but the zones are all I care about.",
    "810017A4": "Lockdown is all about controlling those zones.",
    "810017A5": "Zone control is paramount to your success.",
    "810017A6": "Show me you can defend this City. Lock down those zones!",
    "810017A7": "All zones held! Yes!",
    "810017A8": "Your enemy achieved Lockdown.",
    "810017A9": "Your opponents completed their Lockdown.",
    "810017AA": "That's it! Opponents have Lockdown!",
    "810017AB": "Your opponents captured all zones.",
    "810017AC": "Your opponents are halfway to victory! You know what to do!",
    "810017AD": "Dead even. Those zones are yours to take, Guardian!",
    "810017AF": "You're close to victory!",
    "810017B0": "Lockdown.",
    "810017B1": "They're going for the Lockdown!",
    "810017B2": "Match point! Take the zones!",
    "810017B3": "Match point! Control those zones!",
    "810017B4": "Match point! Dominate those zones!",
    "810017B5": "You've completed your capture. Well done.",
    "810017B6": "And that's a full capture. Impressive.",
    "810017B7": "Capture complete. Few could do it better.",
    "810017B8": "Lockdown achieved! Excellent.",
    "810017B9": "And that's a Lockdown. Perfect.",
    "810017BA": "Lockdown! Yes.",
    "810017BB": "You're halfway. Hold strong!",
    "810017BC": "This is why we must stay vigilant. We could lose the Tower again at any time.",
    "810017BD": "Your opponents had a stronger zone defense. Crush them next time.",
    "810017BE": "Remember when we lost the Tower? This loss is nothing. Fight again.",
    "810017BF": "Territory control is paramount. We can't protect the City if we can't control the zones.",
    "810017C0": "You can do this. Try again, and focus on the zones.",
    "810017C1": "Your opponents achieved a full capture. I can't argue with that.",
    "810017C2": "Do you hear that? The end is coming! FIGHT!",
    "810017C3": "Opponents lead. It's not over yet! Take the zones.",

    "81001832": "Your opponents have won on points—but they can be beaten. Fight again.",
    "81001833": "Your opponents outscored you. I have to give it to them.",
    "81001834": "Your opponents were formidable. That should make your victory all the sweeter.",
    "81001835": "I remember your victories far more than your losses. You like to keep things interesting.",
    "81001836": "I almost jumped in there when it came down to the final round. You've done well.",
    "81001837": "Moments like these are my best memories of the Crucible. Fight again. Please.",
    "81001838": "A hard-fought victory with a worthy climax. Now do it again.",

    "8100183B": "Opponents lead. So what? You have bullets.",
    "8100183C": "Who's left? I think you've killed them all. A shame. I was enjoying myself.",
    "8100183D": "Showdown.",
    "8100183E": "You've trounced and humiliated fellow Guardians. I hope you're happy. I'm happy.",
    "81001840": "You know your way around a gunfight. I may ask you to help my combat frames some day.",
    "81001841": "Well done. I know who to call when the shooting starts.",
    "81001842": "You're all business when it comes to straight-up fights, aren't you? Good.",
    "81001843": "You continue to prove that the best gunfights happen in the Crucible.",

    "81001845": "Who's better than you? Not the other team, obviously. Go fight another one.",
    "81001846": "Doubles.",

    "81001851": "That was close. But well fought.",
    "81001852": "Good. Let nothing stop you.",
    "81001853": "Round four!",
    "81001854": "Round two!",
    "81001855": "Round three!",
    "81001856": "One minute left. You're leading this round!",
    "81001857": "I thought they had you. I forget sometimes that you've trampled some Hive gods.",
    "81001859": "They had the lead and you took the opportunity to shoot them in the back. I love it.",
    "8100185A": "Were you sandbagging the whole time? You had me on the edge of my seat.",
    "8100185B": "Time to fight. Good thing you're in the lead.",
    "8100185C": "Your tactics are working. Keep the lead!",
    "8100185D": "No time to rest! You're in the lead!",
    "8100185E": "They got you, but you fought them all the way to the final showdown. You'll win the next one.",
    "81001860": "Thirty seconds left, and you're trailing. You can do this.",
    "81001861": "You're dead even. I hate ties.",
    "81001862": "You're tied! Not for long.",
    "81001863": "You wanted to make them think they would win, didn't you? Well done.",
    "81001864": "In the right conditions, anyone can be beaten. Remember that, and fight again.",
    "81001865": "You've won the round on points. Well done.",
    "81001866": "Numbers don't lie. This round is yours.",
    "81001867": "I can't argue that. The round goes to you.",
    "81001868": "Opponents on the verge of a score victory!",
    "81001869": "Opponents nearly have the win on points!",
    "8100186A": "Opponents nearing the score limit!",
    "8100186B": "Thirty seconds! You're in the lead. Hold fast!",
    "8100186C": "One minute remains. You're behind, but there's still time!",
    "8100186D": "A few more and you take this!",
    "8100186E": "Your numbers are nearly there!",
    "8100186F": "You're on the verge of a score victory!",
    "81001870": "You'll learn from this. Come back and fight again.",
    "81001871": "Defeat is a much better teacher for you than I am. Fight another one.",
    "81001872": "Defeat comes for us all. What's important is what you choose to do next.",
    "81001873": "There are no losses. Only lessons. Fight again.",
    "81001874": "You lost today, but there's no stopping you. I know you'll be back.",
    "81001875": "You're close to a match victory on points! Advance!",
    "81001876": "Sudden death! I hate ties. And you should, too.",
    "81001877": "You're behind, but you can turn this around.",
    "81001878": "You're trailing. Catch up and crush them!",
    "81001879": "Your opponents are in the lead—you can beat them.",
    "8100187A": "Overtime! There's still fighting to be done.",
    "8100187B": "They pulled that one from under you.",
    "8100187C": "They beat you. Barely.",
    "8100187D": "They had to capture a zone just to beat you.",
    "8100187E": "Traveler's Light. You beat the pants off them. There's a Redjack mission I could use you for, Guardian. They do their jobs, but they're just frames.",
    "81001880": "I have no critiques. You're making my job harder and harder, Guardian. Keep it up.",
    "81001882": "Utter destruction. I want to see you do that again.",
    "81001883": "You killed them more than they killed you. That's all I ask—but keep it in the Crucible, please.",
    "81001BD3": "There are goods out there, and they belong to me. Well, they WILL belong to me. Once you take 'em from them.",
    "81001BD6": "Lost a shipment of contraband from Dead Orbit. It's in the hands of my enemies now. You're gonna get it all back.",
    "81001BD7": "You may come across some valuable resources while hunting our opposition. They belong to yours truly.",
    "81001BD8": "Some of my crew got jumped transporting my 'legally acquired' goods. 'Convince' the thieves who stole them to give it all back.",
    "81001BD9": "I'm told the Vanguard munitions are being hoarded nearby. Heh. Find the culprits and relieve them of it. I want it all.",
    "81001BDA": "So, my opposition thinks they can run New Monarchy contraband through the Shore and not tell me? 'Acquire' it for me. I don't care what it takes.",
    "81001BDB": "Got a 'request' for you. Start knocking in teeth. You should find some stolen Vanguard contraband that way.",
    "81001BDC": "Our mutual enemies have some real pricey goods on their hands. How wonderful it is to have a Guardian of my own to get them for me.",
    "81001BDE": "Banshee-44 asked that we bring back whatever weapons parts we find out here. Let's follow up with some Scorn on that.",
    "81001BE0": "I think everyone on the Shore can agree, life is better without enemies of the Spider around. Make it so.",
    "81001BE4": "I'm just an honest businessman trying to make a buck. Heh. Our mutual adversaries make that challenging. Deal with them.",
    "81001BE6": "I'm sick of hearing about troublemakers on the Shore already. Go kill a few so I can hear about them less.",
    "81001BE8": "MY Shore is no place for opposition to me. Send our enemies packing.",
    "81001BEA": "Fallen or Cabal, Scorn or Hive—I don't care who, just put them down!",
    "81001BEC": "My enemies continue to overrun the Shore. You're the solution.",
    "81001BEE": "What you do in other places is none of my business, but if you're gonna to be here on the Shore, I expect you to handle our mutual enemies.",
    "81001BF1": "A Skiff's not an easy thing to hide. So you can imagine my surprise that the Fallen seem to be using one to disrupt my operation. Find out where they're hiding it.",
    "81001BF4": "The caverns of the Shore run deep, and my fellow Fallen have been using them in their own smuggling operation. See what else they've got down there.",
    "81001BF5": "The Fallen's smuggling operation has always been a thorn in the Vanguard's side. And it all starts here on the Shore. Let's see what we can find out.",
    "81001BF6": "We should gather any intelligence we can on the Fallen in these parts. I'm sure the Vanguard would appreciate it.",
    "81001BF7": "The more Scorn that appear, the more dead Servitors come right along with 'em. If you find any, check them for any remaining Ether.",
    "81001BF8": "Ether's a very valuable commodity around these parts. Check any dead Servitors you come across for leftovers.",
    "81001BF9": "While we're on the Shore, we should keep an eye out for anything the Spider might be interested in. It's best to stay on his good side.",
    "81001BFA": "Have you noticed the dead Servitors around the Shore? Examining them should give us more insight into the Scorn.",
    "81001BFC": "When you're experienced as the Spider, you learn how to salvage junk and turn it into gold. Might be some 'gold' in those High Plains.",
    "81001BFD": "Word is, there's a little bit of the Prison of Elders scattered around the High Plains. See if any of it is worth my time.",
    "81001BFE": "There's a cell from the Prison of Elders just sitting out in the open. Find it and examine it for me. It could be full of beautifully useful information.",
    "81001BFF": "Any information on the Prison of Elders escapees is valuable to the Vanguard and to us. Let's look around for some.",
    "81001C00": "My boys spotted a Skiff careening down over Hellrise Canyon. Might be there's only junk left. Ah, might also be there's salvage. See for yourself.",
    "81001C01": "Most Fallen tech around the Shore is old useless garbage. But sometimes you get lucky. I think today's your lucky day, friend. [laughs]",
    "81001C03": "Anything of value on the Shore belongs to me, and me alone—whether I've found it yet or not. So you'll let me know what you come across, friend, huh?",
    "81001C05": "I've picked up a distress beacon here on the Shore. We should check it out cautiously.",
    "81001C07": "My boys do their best to keep an eye on the Shore for me, but it never hurts to have extra. You see anything juicy, you let me know.",
    "81001C0B": "My enemies are always planning something against little old me. Now, I need to know what it is. And you have the skills for finding out.",
    "81001C0D": "A shipment of New Monarchy contraband is making its way through the Shore. I hear there are outside plans to knock it off. Find out what's in store.",
    "81001C0F": "I'm owed a large shipment of parts. Seller failed to deliver. Get an eye on them.",
    "81001C11": "To beat thine enemy is to know thine enemy. Some information gathering is required, of course.",
    "81001C13": "I need to get to a Vanguard shipment before anybody else, I just don't know when it's passing through the Shore. Find out what you can.",
    "81001C15": "A vat of Ether was stolen right out from under me. Never again. Find out what happened to it, friend.",
    "81001C17": "Keep an eye on the Shore for me. Hey, gotta stay one step ahead of whatever's happening out there at all times.",
    "81001C19": "Lightmonger, I need you to find the whereabouts of a missing 'friend.' You can start by eavesdropping around the Shore.",
    "81001C1C": "Woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. Take it out on a Hive leader for me.",
    "81001C1F": "There's a Hive commander doing business in MY territory. NEVER AGAIN. Go, make it so.",
    "81001C20": "I'm feeling pretty generous today, friend. Gonna give you the opportunity to lay waste to a particularly annoying member of the Hive. Thank me later.",
    "81001C22": "Cayde would've been here hunting Hive, cleaning up the Shore. Let's take down a commander in his honor.",
    "81001C23": "A nearby Hive leader is disrupting the status quo. He needs to be dealt with.",
    "81001C24": "You're gonna go after a Scorn Chieftain for me. What else is a personal Guardian good for?",
    "81001C26": "Still looking to scratch the itch of vengeance for your dearly departed Cayde? This Scorn commander was tangentially related. Haha. Enjoy.",
    "81001C27": "This Scorn Chieftain has been stealing from me. Not anymore. Introduce him to the consequences, firsthand.",
    "81001C28": "Cheated by a Scorn brute. He's gonna learn a hard lesson from you, my friend.",
    "81001C2A": "A Scorn enforcer is nearby. We need to deal with this.",
    "81001C2B": "Zavala's looking to rid the Shore of a Scorn commander. We can take care of that.",
    "81001C2C": "A Cabal I thought I could trust. Should've gone with my instincts. He's still in the area, just begging to be hunted down by you.",
    "81001C2D": "I need a favor of the Cabal variety. This 'favor' is roaming the Shore right now. No need to go easy on him, Lightmonger.",
    "81001C2F": "My crew is being harassed by a Cabal enforcer. The fool doesn't know I have a Guardian in my employ. Shut him up for good.",
    "81001C31": "A wanted Cabal leader is nearby. New Monarchy's been looking for him. We should do the honors.",
    "81001C32": "There's a Cabal brute near here. Vanguard wants him dealt with. It's on us.",
    "81001D8C": "I leave you here.",
    "81001D90": "Claim what has been lost.",
    "81001D92": "Inflict your desires upon reality, Guardian.",
    "81001D94": "One good death deserves another.",
    "81001D96": "Paracausality! What a trip. If you believe your weapon wants to murder all existence, then so it will. Call it a little bad juju, if you please",
    "80C23696": "You’re just in time! I’m planning a little party of sorts in the EDZ for our Fallen, Cabal, and Taken...friends. All Guardians are invited.",
    "80C23699": "I'll bring the tea. You bring the bullets.",
    "80C2369A": "Together, we have done the impossible. We’ve secured the EDZ. A temporary victory, to be sure, but I will celebrate regardless.",
    "80C2369B": "A party favor for you. May it serve you well out in the wilds.",
    "80C2371B": "I've heard about what you accomplished in the Crucible. Overheard, rather. Shaxx can be... loud, when he’s excited.",
    "80C2371E": "You’ve reminded me of my Crucible days, when I was brash and glorious, and my shadow made Guardians tremble. I had almost forgotten... For that, you have my thanks.",
    "80C2371F": "Are they still talking about my days in the Crucible? I assure you, Shaxx and I have resolved our differences since then. He has also made a full recovery.",
    "80C23720": "Still, sometimes I miss it. I wonder...",
    "80C23721": "If I had an agent in the Crucible, Shaxx would not need to know.",
    "80C23723": "Your legend precedes you. I've heard how you walked worlds and rained down fury. In the briefest span of time, you have made the Tower whisper of Warlocks again.",
    "80C23725": "I have something for you, to mark this day. I wonder what you will do with it.",
    "80C23726": "It is good to see a fellow scholar. As Warlocks, our wisdom and curiosity light the way for others.",
    "80C23728": "Perhaps the time has come to remind the world of all that Warlocks can do. What do you think?",
    "80C237DF": "Just the Guardian I was hoping to see. I’m ordering a blitz across the Arcology today: all available forces, all targets.",
    "80C237E3": "That means you. Now move out!",
    "80C237E5": "With that mass mobilization, the Arcology’s pretty much locked down. Good work.",
    "80C237E6": "That said, if you want to keep shining light into those dark corners, (beat) I’ve got something for you.",
    "80C237E9": "I know you’ll put it to good use.",
    "80C23874": "Word of your achievements has reached me. Titans like us hold this City together. We are its heart and its truest defense.",
    "80C2387B": "Take this, and add another chapter to our legend.",
    "80C2387F": "It’s been too long since I’ve reviewed the Titans en masse. Care for a field exercise?",
    "80C23882": "We Titans are the pillars of this City. Let's show them what that means.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "I'll be here when you need me.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "The Vex don't do anything without a reason. Be careful out there.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "If I had glimmer for every construct I've downed, I could rebuild the City twice over.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Just finished up in the Crucible, right? I can tell, you've got a bit of an  odor to you.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "We need you to resolve a situation here in the Dead Zone.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Your EDZ task was no trouble, I see.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Next time you get the chance, ask Ikora about 'that time with the Fallen and her Exo boyfriend.' She'll know what I mean. Great story.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Why do people keep asking me what it was like to build the Wall? You all know Zavala was there right? Do you guys never talk?",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Breath in  breath out  breath in  don't listen to all the people  breath out  breath in  don't answer that comm call  breath out ",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Zavala, we're fine. Yes, we're fine. You don't have to   yes, I'll expect your call again in 12 hours.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Yeah, we blew up their space cannon. It's a good start, but we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Zavala sent you out here for a reason, right? ",
    "FFFFFFFF": "You're not going to laugh at the Kinderguardians. You're too old for that, you're better than that. Hold it together girl.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Luz, I swear, if you go telling the Guardians I’m your Shutzengel again, I'll tell them about that time with the honey when you were ten.",
    "FFFFFFFF": "Attention, all guardians: Cabal threat-response team bound for the basin coastline. Steer clear.",
    "80BB2E21": "This is a City of tragedy; and of hope. Its legends tell me so.",
    "80BB2E24": "I'm glad the Sunbreaker fighting style found a good home.",
    "80BB2E25": "Ouros should see this place. How far it's come.",
    "80BB2E26": "This world's getting darker, Guardian. I hope your Light is up for the challenge.",
    "80BB2E27": "I can't tell the future, but I know you'll play a part.",
    "80BB2E28": "Your legend's not finished, Guardian. Get out there.",
    "80BB2E29": "I waited too long to return to the City, Guardian. Don't repeat my mistake.",
    "80BB2E2A": "So much has happened since the Sunbreakers left.",
    "80BB2E2B": "Wait too long and the legend will move on without you, Guardian.",
    "80BB2E2C": "When my Ghost woke me for the first time, the battle of Twilight Gap was raging. She asked me to make a choice between the City and the Sunbreakers. I chose to leave. Perhaps that was a mistake.",
    "80BB2E2D": "Twilight Gap was my first memory as a Guardian. My first battle, too. I was glad to do my part.",
    "80BB2E2E": "This armor? I was at Twilight Gap. Forged this armor myself from plasteel I scavenged off fallen Guardians; I'll bear their weight until my last day. Least I can do.",
    "80BB2E2F": "Have you been sung the songs of Ashraven, Felwinter's Dawnblade? She had another name, to those that knew her.",
    "80BB2E30": "Zavala thinks I speak in too many symbols? He actually said that? My fist is a symbol. For a blow to his face.",
